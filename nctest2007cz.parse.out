Racially
divided
Europe
typical
feature
of
European
far-right
is
her
racism
and
that
the
use
of
immigration
issues
in
their
political
favor
.
42 15
Italian
Lega
Nord
,
Vlaams
Blok
Dutch
,
French
Le
Pen
's
National
Front
-
are
all
examples
of
parties
or
movements
arising
from
a
common
aversion
to
immigrants
and
promoting
simplistic
view
on
how
to
address
the
issue
of
immigration
.
31 10
While
individuals
like
Jörg
Haider
or
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
and
coming
-LRB-
never
too
early
-RRB-
go
,
the
question
of
race
and
racism
of
European
politics
just
now
disappeared
.
23 9
For
increasing
racial
fragmentation
in
European
countries
,
there
are
two
factors
:
an
aging
population
and
the
opening
of
the
border
.
31 14
right-wing
and
left-wing
parties
centered
around
the
political
center
hide
from
this
problem
head
in
the
sand
,
hoping
against
hope
that
the
issue
of
immigration
,
once
it
disappears
.
10 9
But
she
disappears
to
foreshadow
America
's
racial
history
.
37 13
race
relations
is
in
the
United
States
for
decades
at
the
center
of
political
debate
,
to
the
extent
that
racial
differences
are
as
important
as
extra
income
and
often
determined
by
political
preferences
and
attitudes
.
29 17
first
step
to
grasp
the
racial
policy
is
to
understand
the
origins
and
consequences
of
racial
intolerance
,
even
if
it
means
that
come
to
light
uncomfortable
truths
.
19 7
In
the
United
States
took
care
of
that
extensive
economic
,
sociological
,
psychological
and
political
science
surveys
.
58 25
It
emerged
that
people
of
different
races
to
each
other
much
less
confident
that
whites
can
not
afford
to
support
social
spending
because
they
are
perceived
to
help
minorities
and
racially
fragmented
communities
are
much
less
effective
government
,
rampant
corruption
in
them
,
nepotism
and
crime
and
have
a
less
productive
public
goods
per
tax
dollar
.
49 20
That
does
not
mean
that
the
solution
is
to
eliminate
all
diversity
and
build
a
racially
homogeneous
community
,
but
that
we
can
begin
to
build
a
sound
public
policy
in
addressing
relations
between
different
races
,
it
is
paramount
to
not
admit
the
existence
of
these
problems
.
10 7
True
,
the
Americans
are
united
in
this
direction
.
22 12
Some
argue
for
positive
discrimination
that
minorities
accorded
preference
in
recruitment
at
the
college
and
in
the
allocation
of
public
contracts
.
32 15
This
policy
is
perceived
not
only
as
compensation
for
historical
injustices
,
but
also
as
a
way
of
creating
positive
examples
of
human
and
suppression
of
persistent
and
perhaps
unwitting
discrimination
.
54 17
But
it
is
also
quite
a
few
people
who
are
agitating
against
positive
discrimination
and
who
claim
that
,
in
order
to
create
jobs
for
minorities
and
that
black
families
remained
together
,
just
good
,
,
rasoslepá
``
policy
combined
with
a
policy
of
free
trade
and
the
support
of
family
values
.
39 14
support
family
values
is
critical
in
any
policy
,
because
even
the
most
major
cause
of
poverty
in
the
USA
is
a
huge
number
of
single-parent
households
-LRB-
read
:
a
single
mother
-RRB-
within
the
black
community
.
23 10
we
do
not
have
solutions
,
but
this
is
mainly
about
that
U.S.
policy
toward
racial
issue
at
least
,
the
position
.
11 8
Minorities
are
obviously
hugely
progress
towards
integration
and
economic
success
.
30 15
In
the
fifties
,
blacks
were
not
allowed
to
sit
in
front
of
the
bus
,
and
today
the
two
blacks
on
the
very
top
of
American
foreign
policy
.
20 6
right-wing
American
politicians
,
of
course
,
today
the
tactical
use
of
the
racial
issue
as
a
political
tool
.
26 10
example
,
Patrick
Buchanan
,
a
former
adviser
to
Presidents
Nixon
and
Reagan
,
who
in
the
last
U.S.
presidential
election
as
an
independent
candidate
.
24 13
recently
successfully
issued
a
book
entitled
,
The
Dying
Sun
``
about
how
dying
populations
and
immigrant
invasions
threaten
America
and
Western
civilization
.
21 9
For
every
one
such
book
,
however
,
is
based
on
ten
others
that
American
racial
issue
is
serious
analysis
.
18 9
V
Europe
,
but
political
analysis
and
debate
on
relations
between
different
races
is
falling
far
short
.
35 11
In
the
best
case
,
this
issue
speaks
very
limited
,
in
terms
of
immigration
quotas
and
border
restrictions
,
and
not
in
terms
of
social
problems
and
opportunities
that
Europe
offers
racially
mixed
.
16 9
To
stop
the
increase
of
illegal
immigrants
is
of
course
necessary
to
clear
immigration
policy
.
20 8
But
it
does
not
stop
there
:
American
racial
policy
also
does
not
end
controls
on
the
US-Mexican
border
!
7 6
Europe
is
rich
and
hurriedly
ages
.
25 11
Europeans
,
protected
by
generous
social
programs
,
they
refuse
to
do
,
dirty
work
``
in
agriculture
or
even
in
the
leather
industry
.
7 6
increase
in
immigrants
is
therefore
inevitable
.
32 13
Europeans
while
but
never
miss
an
opportunity
to
criticize
America
for
any
failure
in
its
policy
towards
minorities
or
for
any
manifestation
of
racism
on
the
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
.
54 11
When
he
starts
reading
the
European
press
,
you
can
not
help
but
notice
a
sort
of
superiority
complex
towards
the
United
States
on
the
issue
of
racial
politics
:
they
,
the
Americans
have
problems
with
racism
,
we
Europeans
are
immune
to
it
,
maybe
the
crazed
neo-Nazis
and
the
like
.
55 16
But
just
what
in
recent
weeks
,
from
Paris
to
Amsterdam
,
proves
that
the
racial
problem
in
Europe
is
much
deeper
,
as
in
the
USA
based
on
the
sad
truth
that
race
relations
are
inherently
complex
,
and
that
trust
and
cooperation
between
the
human
race
is
not
always
obvious
and
easy
.
51 16
not
start
if
the
main
European
political
parties
with
all
seriousness
and
sincerity
to
invest
in
understanding
racial
tensions
in
Europe
and
failing
racial
issue
one
of
their
main
priorities
,
take
that
individuals
Le
Pen
's
stamping
will
not
hesitate
to
by
this
vacuum
to
fulfill
its
hateful
message
.
28 8
fight
with
the
French
exception
attention
of
Europe
today
denied
the
right
to
enlargement
and
the
European
Constitution
,
currently
under
development
by
the
EU
Member
States
.
26 10
The
fate
of
the
new
and
enlarged
Europe
,
however
,
will
be
no
less
important
result
of
several
French
skirmishes
with
the
European
Commission
.
24 11
France
has
decided
to
unilaterally
ignore
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
,
because
its
highly
anticipated
budget
deficit
exceeds
3
%
of
GDP
.
22 9
The
French
pride
themselves
sober
and
rational
thinking
,
but
when
it
comes
to
budgets
,
then
Descartes
replaced
the
confusion
.
29 11
when
the
Irish
government
in
2000
reduced
its
fiscal
surplus
of
4
%
of
GDP
by
just
half
a
percent
,
belonged
to
France
for
its
leading
critics
.
21 11
Stability
Pact
has
violated
other
countries
,
but
France
is
the
first
to
do
so
with
open
derision
and
defiance
.
6 6
This
should
not
surprise
anyone
.
15 9
France
simply
apply
the
EU
rules
ingrained
habit
perceive
their
own
culture
as
exceptional
.
14 9
French
,
for
example
continually
vetoing
the
reform
of
the
common
agricultural
policy
.
36 16
nowadays
,
even
children
know
that
this
policy
is
pleasant
and
completely
undeserved
gift
wealthy
European
-LRB-
especially
French
-RRB-
farmers
at
the
expense
of
struggling
farmers
in
developing
countries
and
consumers
in
the
EU
.
26 18
France
also
seeks
a
return
to
the
old
policy
of
non-profit
rescue
private
companies
who
are
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
for
taxpayers
'
money
.
35 16
EU
Commissioner
for
Competition
Mario
Monti
is
in
such
a
battle
can
not
let
go
:
it
needs
the
support
of
those
who
believe
in
free
markets
and
a
level
playing
field
for
all
.
5 5
story
is
that
simple
.
28 16
French
government
plans
to
rescue
Alstom
,
which
has
developed
a
range
of
high
technology
products
,
including
the
French
TGV
train
,
but
recently
declared
bankruptcy
.
32 15
The
government
says
that
plan
to
rescue
Alstom
,
never
give
up
,
that
is
all
the
while
guided
by
well-known
dirigistickými
themes
:
maintaining
employment
,
investor
protection
,
etc.
.
30 10
Because
the
extra
technology
company
Alstom
,
the
French
government
also
pulls
the
card
of
research
and
development
,
arguing
investment
in
research
and
development
to
support
the
growth
.
8 6
rescue
of
Alstom
nationalization
is
obviously
incorrect
.
30 13
This
company
is
made
up
of
many
different
parts
,
some
of
which
are
profitable
and
others
are
failing
:
it
would
be
a
no-brainer
to
split
the
company
.
18 10
profitable
parts
such
as
TGV
,
buyers
can
easily
find
,
while
unprofitable
operations
should
be
closed
.
26 16
French
taxpayers
'
money
would
be
more
effectively
spent
on
temporary
support
for
workers
made
redundant
than
the
subsidies
that
will
keep
alive
unprofitable
factories
.
35 19
It
is
important
that
the
European
Commission
did
not
allow
France
to
sew
on
the
issue
of
competition
at
the
level
of
specific
rules
,
as
was
apparently
done
in
terms
of
budget
deficits
.
22 10
Commission
must
prevent
the
French
state
aid
to
private
companies
,
as
well
as
subsidies
impossible
in
any
other
EU
country
.
24 13
In
this
field
,
the
Commission
has
already
achieved
some
success
,
particularly
when
forced
Germany
to
abolish
government
guarantees
to
state-owned
banks
.
22 9
France
as
a
whole
and
firm
Alstom
especially
should
not
be
an
exception
and
should
be
held
to
the
same
standards
.
21 9
If
the
commission
does
not
act
,
the
EU
will
still
look
more
like
a
playground
for
French
civil
servants
.
28 12
France
already
has
taken
a
leading
role
in
EU
foreign
policy
,
where
Foreign
Minister
Dominique
de
Villepin
increasingly
looks
and
acts
as
Foreign
Minister
of
Europe
.
20 9
At
the
same
time
France
violates
the
rules
of
the
key
economic
policy
and
state
aid
to
private
companies
.
19 9
losses
of
the
European
Commission
remains
of
its
credibility
and
ultimately
to
commemorate
the
smaller
district
of
Paris
?
20 8
Defeat
in
the
case
of
Alstom
would
have
profound
implications
for
Europe
-
and
not
just
in
the
competition
.
54 19
war
for
oil
For
decades
America
through
Democratic
and
Republican
presidential
administrations
fills
in
straightforward
energy
policy
objectives
:
keep
world
oil
prices
as
stable
as
possible
,
as
painlessly
as
possible
reduce
domestic
oil
consumption
,
by
reducing
the
possibility
of
dependence
on
imports
from
abroad
to
diversify
sources
of
imported
oil
.
14 7
Although
it
might
seem
,
none
of
these
objectives
for
the
Bush
administration
.
23 15
Many
observers
believe
that
Bush
set
a
new
course
,
since
it
appears
that
the
invasion
of
Iraq
face
of
these
objectives
.
31 14
substantial
increase
in
production
in
Iraq
would
probably
increase
U.S.
dependence
on
oil
relative
to
other
energy
sources
,
as
to
the
additional
supplies
will
probably
fall
in
oil
prices
.
20 9
This
will
result
in
a
mean
increase
in
U.S.
dependence
on
imported
oil
,
especially
from
the
Middle
East
.
53 12
irony
,
however
,
that
the
U.S.
had
over
the
Iraqi
oil
sector
much
more
power
during
the
pre-war
under
the
UN
Oil-for-food
''
-LRB-
in
which
not
Saddam
Hussein
,
but
the
United
Nations
determined
the
level
of
Iraqi
oil
sales
abroad
-RRB-
than
it
will
in
the
future
democratic
Iraq
.
33 10
If
the
Bush
administration
was
seeking
a
permanent
,
safe
,
diverse
and
cheap
oil
supplies
could
simply
lift
the
embargo
on
Libya
,
Iran
,
Iraq
and
Sudan
and
oil
gush
.
15 6
U.S.
interest
in
Iraqi
oil
was
not
driven
or
economic
,
or
energy
policy
.
12 9
Bush
administration
recognized
that
Iraqi
oil
is
especially
critical
geopolitical
asset
.
7 7
Who
controls
Iraqi
oil
controls
Iraq
.
16 9
Saddam
's
power
came
from
his
control
of
the
world
's
second
largest
oil
reserves
.
12 9
role
that
oil
in
his
power
played
,
very
well
realized
.
21 13
When
Saddam
was
forced
to
face
the
possibility
of
invasion
and
defeat
,
threatened
to
burn
the
Iraqi
oil
fields
.
25 10
Much
of
the
subsequent
destruction
and
looting
of
oil
facilities
and
pipelines
reflects
the
widespread
realization
that
control
of
oil
means
control
of
Iraq
.
19 9
At
the
time
,
the
U.S.
planned
invasion
,
became
a
critical
priority
for
securing
the
oil
fields
.
30 13
goal
was
not
increased
supplies
or
reduced
prices
for
Americans
,
but
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
Saddam
and
ultimately
establish
and
consolidate
the
new
Iraqi
government
.
12 8
Iraq
's
future
directly
depends
on
the
fate
of
Iraqi
oil
.
44 16
However
,
due
to
the
vagaries
of
the
oil
industry
,
particularly
in
such
unstable
conditions
,
it
is
difficult
to
predict
how
much
will
be
in
the
next
few
years
,
the
Bush
administration
is
able
to
fulfill
its
goals
in
Iraq
.
4 5
logic
is
simple
.
20 12
USA
must
use
oil
revenues
to
the
U.S.
tax
payers
lift
the
burden
of
financing
regime
change
in
Iraq
.
20 10
All
reconstruction
plans
depend
in
the
long
term
,
the
ability
of
Iraq
to
export
oil
in
large
quantities
.
25 10
If
Iraq
oil
to
monetize
,
then
President
Bush
fails
to
deliver
on
promises
to
the
Iraqi
and
American
people
and
the
world
community
.
16 7
Before
the
invasion
,
Iraq
's
oil
production
capacity
reached
three
million
barrels
per
day
.
23 11
within
the
time
needed
to
establish
an
Iraqi
government
,
Iraq
will
not
be
able
to
increase
its
production
to
that
level
.
25 8
Any
increase
in
Iraqi
oil
production
requires
developing
the
oil
fields
,
a
large
investment
,
legitimate
,
representative
government
,
and
political
stability
.
11 9
Early
meet
these
requirements
does
not
expect
the
Bush
administration
.
11 7
Political
stability
is
the
main
condition
for
increasing
production
capacity
.
39 12
Historical
evidence
from
Iran
,
Kuwait
,
Russia
,
and
even
Iraq
itself
,
suggest
that
the
reintroduction
of
political
stability
it
takes
about
three
years
to
increase
capacity
significantly
and
the
new
,
higher
level
is
maintained
.
39 18
Iraq
needs
several
years
to
write
a
new
constitution
,
created
a
legitimate
democratic
government
to
negotiate
the
distribution
of
oil
revenues
among
the
regions
,
has
introduced
new
investment
laws
and
make
the
economy
attractive
to
foreigners
.
34 12
also
needs
time
to
negotiate
with
the
international
oil
companies
and
neighboring
countries
,
to
conduct
technical
and
feasibility
studies
,
and
for
the
reconstruction
,
modernization
and
exploration
of
its
oil
fields
.
33 14
optimistic
is
thus
also
a
three-year
time
frame
,
which
assumes
that
during
this
period
,
the
occupation
will
end
and
the
Iraqis
establish
their
own
democratic
government
,
bringing
political
stability
.
10 6
situation
,
of
course
,
can
evolve
quite
differently
.
6 7
tension
may
persist
for
years
.
20 11
Nobody
should
be
surprised
,
moreover
that
,
even
if
the
democratic
government
of
Iraqi
oil
production
suddenly
ceased
.
24 13
History
suggests
that
labor
strikes
and
similar
disruptions
that

If

this

How

Who
will

,
if
it
can
not
provide
the
Iraqi
people
food
,

and

26 14
These
are
tough
questions
that
are
essentially
unanswerable
until
Iraq
is
stable

Leave

If
it
were
not
so
deeply
depressing
,
the
following
message
might
be
grim
joke
of
the
millennium
:
Libya
was
elected
presidency
of
the
Commission
on
Human
Rights
of
the
UN
!

When

procedure
was
of
course
perfectly
legal
:
Presidency
every
year
,
moving
from
one
world
region
to
another
.
11 6
This
year
,
the
President
proposed
and
nominated
Africa
Libya
.
8 6
voted
against
the
USA
and
Canada
only
.
10 5
To
their
everlasting
shame
,
the
European
countries
abstained
.
24 14
It
is
a
telling
commentary
to
address
the
moral
bankruptcy
of
the
United
Nations
that
this
decision
comes
as
the
organization
so
delicate
.
58 25
President
Bush
urged
the
United
Nations
to
indicate
that
it
takes
seriously
its
own
binding
decisions
on
Iraq
:
because
otherwise
it
could
turn
out
as
well
as
inglorious
League
of
Nations
,
which
is
in
the
thirties
proved
to
be
incompetent
,
he
had
to
face
an
aggressive
political
attitudes
of
Nazi
Germany
and
Fascist
Italy
.
30 16
Select
now
Libya
to
head
the
UN
body
,
which
is
responsible
for
human
rights
,
hardly
helps
to
strengthen
the
legitimacy
and
moral
authority
of
the
world
organization
.
8 6
Recall
:
Libya
is
a
totalitarian
tyranny
.
22 8
Its
leader
,
Muammar
Gaddafi
,
enriching
its
sometimes
erratic
behavior
of
extremist
political
approaches
and
supports
the
world
's
dictators
.
27 10
stands
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
most
repressive
regimes
in
the
world
where
at
the
election
pretends
dissent
and
constantly
goes
for
the
jugular
.
22 9
Under
his
rule
,
Libya
helped
terrorist
organizations
from
around
the
world
-
from
the
IRA
to
various
Palestinian
extremist
groups
.
30 14
so
far
is
under
UN
sanctions
because
of
the
role
they
have
played
ten
years
ago
in
a
bomb
attack
on
a
Pan
Am
airliner
over
Lockerbie
,
Scotland
.

In
the
past
decade
,
the
UN
's
standing
as
a
symbol
of
the
ideals
of
peaceful
global
society
continually
worse
.
13 11
The
organization
proved
utterly
unable
to
stop
the
war
in
the
Balkans
.
38 14
In
doing
so
,
at
least
in
one
case
-
Srebrenica
-
Dutch
UN
peacekeeping
forces
stood
by
and
watched
the
worst
massacre
in
post-war
Europe
,
where
Bosnian
Serbs
murdered
around
six
thousand
unarmed
Muslim
men
.
16 10
Dutch
commission
of
inquiry
later
acknowledged
that
the
UN
flag
was
complicit
in
war
crimes
.
40 11
When
the
Rwandan
genocide
began
,
the
representative
of
the
United
Nations
responsible
for
peacekeeping
operations
ordered
the
evacuation
of
UN
troops
from
the
country
,
leaving
the
field
completely
open
nejkrvavějšímu
genocidal
massacre
since
the
Second
World
War
.
11 6
The
representative
of
the
United
Nations
Kofi
Annan
is
appointed
.
38 17
It
is
a
pesky
and
woeful
record
in
history
that
the
UN
is
trying
-
probably
in
vain
-
to
atone
for
the
fact
that
the
Iraq
crisis
acts
as
a
voice
of
reason
and
international
legitimacy
.
51 18
But
when
UN
inspections
in
Iraq
resemble
the
Salvation
Army
sent
in
to
destroy
a
group
of
thugs
,
the
uplift
of
Libya
to
chair
the
Commission
on
Human
Rights
can
be
written
down
in
history
as
the
ultimate
failure
of
an
organization
whose
life
began
with
so
many
expectations
.
24 15
Organizations
usually
do
not
die
-
and
it
certainly
is
reason
enough
for
us
to
ensure
that
the
UN
will
continue
to
limp
.
15 11
But
it
will
be
only
a
shadow
of
what
it
should
and
could
be
.

authoritarians
outside
the
gates
Last
Thursday
my
judges
Indonesia
's
Central
Jakarta
Court
sentenced
him
to
one
year
in
prison
.
50 12
As
editor
of
the
news
magazine
Tempo
I
by
the
court
guilty
of
libel
against
the
business
tycoon
Tomy
Winata
behalf
that
I
indirectly
suggested
its
possible
share
of
the
textile
market
on
fire
for
South-East
Asia
in
Jakarta
and
the
dissemination
of
lies
that
I
instigated
the
riots
.
21 10
is
my
case
,
and
others
like
it
,
portend
the
end
of
another
short-lived
experiment
with
democracy
in
Indonesia
?
45 18
``
riot
''
that
I
allegedly
fomented
occurred
in
May
last
year
,
when
almost
two
hundred
thugs
referred
to
themselves
as
Mr.
Winata
's
followers
attacked
Tempo
's
office
,
threatened
to
burn
down
the
building
,
harassed
staff
and
injured
one
reporter
.
37 14
In
an
attempt
to
help
resolve
the
situation
peacefully
,
I
was
persuaded
to
act
on
the
central
police
station
in
Jakarta
,
but
to
my
horror
I
discovered
that
controlled
the
station
the
mob
leaders
.
12 9
I
was
punched
and
kicked
while
police
looked
the
other
way
.
13 7
Fortunately
,
to
our
rescue
many
journalists
with
tape
recorders
and
cameras
.
15 12
Their
broadcasts
caused
a
public
outcry
that
forced
parliament
to
organize
a
public
hearing
.
23 10
K
were
called
national
and
Jakarta
police
chief
and
leaders
of
the
mob
were
under
massive
public
pressure
accused
of
the
crime
.
26 9
Winata
itself
,
however
,
Police
investigations
escaped
,
and
only
on
the
public
statement
that
his
followers
acted
without
his
prior
knowledge
and
consent
.
27 15
Winata
then
filed
a
private
criminal
complaint
against
Ahmad
Taufik
,
who
wrote
the
article
,
Teuku
Iskandar
Ali
,
who
edited
it
,
and
me
.
16 9
yearlong
court
proceedings
were
marked
by
a
series
of
suspicious
developments
,
all
favoring
Winata
.
24 9
So
First
,
the
case
by
the
police
and
the
public
prosecutor
so
blatantly
falsified
documents
that
the
police
accused
the
two
officers
.
18 14
But
the
court
rejected
our
request
that
proceedings
be
delayed
until
clarify
the
legality
of
the
state
.
14 9
case
against
the
officers
involved
in
the
falsification
seems
to
be
going
nowhere
.
19 12
One
of
them
was
promoted
to
command
the
newly
formed
-LRB-
and
funded
-RRB-
anti-terrorist
unit
in
Jakarta
.
15 11
other
has
reportedly
been
sent
to
the
police
academy
,
school
for
advanced
training
.
31 9
the
sixth
month
of
the
case
,
the
presiding
judge
in
the
three-judge
panel
was
suddenly
promoted
to
the
Chair
of
the
Municipal
Court
in
a
one-hour
drive
from
Jakarta
.
25 13
One
of
my
lawyers
noted
that
in
35
years
of
practice
in
the
courts
have
never
seen
a
presiding
judge
dismissed
the
ongoing
case
.
18 11
Judge
fact
,
despite
the
advancement
and
continued
to
preside
over
another
case
in
the
same
building
.
