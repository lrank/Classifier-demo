Racial
house
divided
Europe
The
extreme
right
in
Europe
is
characterized
by
its
racism
and
its
use
of
the
issue
of
immigration
as
a
political
divergence
.
47 12
Northern
League
in
Italy
,
the
Vlaams
Blok
in
the
Netherlands
,
supporters
of
the
National
Front
of
Le
Pen
in
France
,
are
all
examples
of
parties
or
movements
formed
on
the
common
theme
of
aversion
towards
immigrants
and
promotion
simplistic
policies
to
control
them
.
32 9
While
people
like
Jorg
Haidar
and
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
can
go
and
-LRB-
soon
enough
-RRB-
come
the
racial
issue
will
never
go
away
of
European
policy
in
the
near
future
.
15 8
An
aging
population
and
borders
increasingly
open
imply
increasing
racial
fragmentation
in
European
countries
.
31 13
The
dominant
parties
of
the
center
left
and
center
right
have
faced
this
perspective
by
applying
the
policy
of
the
ostrich
,
hoping
against
hope
that
the
problem
would
disappear
.
16 11
It
will
not
be
the
case
,
as
demonstrated
clearly
the
racial
history
of
America
.
46 17
Race
relations
in
the
United
States
have
monopolized
for
decades
-
and
still
monopolize
-
the
forefront
of
the
political
scene
,
to
the
point
that
racial
divisions
occupy
as
important
as
income
,
if
not
more
space
as
determinants
of
preferences
and
political
attitudes
.
31 15
The
first
step
in
addressing
the
issue
of
racial
politics
is
to
understand
the
origin
and
consequences
of
racial
animosity
,
even
if
it
means
discovering
unpleasant
truths
to
hear
.
25 10
This
is
precisely
the
aim
pursued
largely
by
teams
of
research
in
economics
,
sociology
,
psychology
and
political
science
in
the
United
States
.
62 19
This
research
demonstrates
that
representatives
of
different
races
are
much
less
confident
with
each
other
,
whites
are
less
likely
to
support
spending
on
social
assistance
,
which
they
believe
will
help
minorities
,
more
racially
fragmented
communities
have
less
effective
governments
,
corruption
and
trafficking
of
major
influence
,
higher
crime
rate
and
less
productive
public
goods
per
dollar
taxed
.
36 18
This
does
not
mean
eliminating
heterogeneity
and
create
racially
homogeneous
communities
,
but
it
is
necessary
to
recognize
the
reality
of
these
problems
in
order
to
begin
to
develop
sound
public
policies
on
race
relations
.
10 8
course
,
Americans
are
challenging
the
methods
to
use
.
26 14
Some
are
in
favor
of
affirmative
action
programs
that
give
minorities
preference
in
the
allocation
of
employment
,
admission
to
the
university
and
public
contracts
.
30 12
These
policies
are
seen
as
a
means
to
provide
reparations
for
past
injustices
and
,
more
importantly
,
create
role
models
and
overcome
the
remaining
discrimination
and
perhaps
unintentional
.
41 13
Other
protest
against
affirmative
action
and
support
a
policy
that
does
not
care
about
race
,
associated
with
the
free
market
and
pro
family
values
policies
,
enough
to
create
jobs
for
minorities
and
help
them
not
separate
black
families
.
36 11
This
last
point
is
critical
in
any
policy
as
one
of
the
most
important
poverty
in
the
United
States
causes
is
the
diffusion
of
single
parents
-LRB-
read
single
mother
-RRB-
in
the
black
community
.
23 15
Whatever
the
answer
,
the
question
is
the
determination
of
the
action
on
the
race
is
a
dominant
issue
in
American
politics
.
13 8
course
,
minorities
have
made
progress
towards
greater
integration
and
economic
success
.
27 10
In
the
1950s
,
blacks
could
not
sit
in
front
of
the
bus
,
now
two
of
the
main
actors
in
American
foreign
policy
are
black
.
21 14
can
not
deny
that
the
American
right-wing
politicians
continue
to
make
the
``
race
card
''
as
a
tactical
tool
.
22 15
Take
the
case
of
Patrick
Buchanan
,
former
assistant
Nixon
and
Reagan
has
brought
independent
presidential
candidate
in
the
last
election
.

Country
and
Civilization
.
''
24 15
But
for
every
book
like
this
,
there
are
ten
others
who
have
a
serious
analysis
of
the
issue
of
race
in
America
.
14 7
analysis
and
policy
debates
on
race
relations
have
a
considerable
delay
in
Europe
.
33 13
At
most
,
the
question
is
scrutinized
in
terms
of
immigration
quotas
and
restrictions
of
borders
,
not
in
terms
of
opportunities
and
social
problems
created
by
a
Europe
increasingly
racially
mixed
.
16 11
course
,
a
clear
immigration
policy
is
needed
to
prevent
the
accumulation
of
illegal
immigrants
.
24 10
But
do
not
stop
there
:
border
controls
in
Mexico
does
not
mean
the
end
of
U.S.
policy
on
domestic
issues
of
race
!
36 13
Europe
is
rich
and
rapidly
aging
population
:
Europeans
,
backed
by
generous
welfare
programs
,
are
no
longer
prepared
to
accept
``
dirty
jobs
''
in
,
say
,
agriculture
and
the
leather
sector
.
9 7
This
attitude
makes
the
inevitable
increase
in
immigration
.
30 13
However
Europeans
are
quick
to
criticize
the
United
States
for
the
failures
of
their
policies
towards
minorities
and
all
manifestations
of
racism
on
the
other
side
of
the
Atlantic
.
46 13
reading
the
European
press
often
reveals
a
superiority
complex
towards
the
United
States
on
racial
issues
:
they
-LRB-
the
Americans
-RRB-
have
problems
with
racism
,
we
are
immunized
against
him
,
with
the
exception
of
skinhead
neo
-
crazy
Nazis
and
their
ilk
.
51 16
This
happened
in
recent
weeks
,
from
Paris
to
Amsterdam
,
demonstrates
that
the
racial
problem
in
Europe
is
deeper
,
and
as
the
United
States
,
because
the
sad
truth
that
racial
relations
are
inherently
difficult
and
that
trust
and
cooperative
behavior
does
not
travel
well
on
racial
lines
.
50 17
If
mainstream
parties
in
Europe
do
not
commit
more
seriously
to
understand
the
racial
tensions
that
exist
in
their
country
and
put
``
race
''
in
the
center
of
their
priorities
,
individuals
such
as
Le
Pen
try
always
try
to
fill
the
void
with
their
message
of
hate
.

Fighting
French
exception
The
attention
of
Europe
is
now
whole
tour
and
about
to
enlargement
and
the
constitution
being
negotiated
between
the
Member
States
.
27 12
However
,
the
result
of
several
spats
Gallic
with
the
European
Commission
will
not
be
less
important
in
determining
the
fate
of
the
new
enlarged
Europe
.
24 18
France
has
unilaterally
chosen
to
ignore
the
Stability
and
Growth
letting
it
run
its
deficit
beyond
the
limit
of
3
%
of
GDP
.
31 12
The
French
love
to
talk
about
the
rational
rigor
of
their
thinking
,
but
where
budgets
are
concerned
,
Descartes
is
no
longer
appropriate
and
the
confusion
made
his
entrance
.
35 14
The
France
was
one
of
the
main
criticisms
of
Ireland
when
,
in
2000
,
the
Irish
government
reduced
its
budget
surplus
,
which
was
at
4
%
,
just
a
simple
0.5
%
.
24 13
Other
countries
have
not
respected
the
Stability
Pact
,
but
France
is
the
first
country
to
do
so
with
a
smirk
openly
contemptuous
.
6 6
None
of
this
should
surprise
.
19 12
The
France
only
applying
European
regulations
its
well
anchored
to
consider
their
own
culture
as
an
exception
usual
.
17 9
Thus
,
France
consistently
vetoed
any
reform
of
the
common
agricultural
policy
of
the
European
Union
.
38 15
As
everyone
knows
,
the
CAP
is
a
very
nice
gift
offered
to
wealthy
European
farmers
-LRB-
particularly
French
farmers
-RRB-
who
deserve
nothing
,
at
the
expense
of
farmers
in
difficulty
developing
countries
and
European
consumers
.
29 21
France
also
tried
to
revert
to
the
old
policy
of
bailing
out
private
companies
in
deficit
and
on
the
verge
of
collapse
with
a
lot
of
public
money
.
30 15
European
Commissioner
for
Competition
Mario
Monti
,
can
not
lose
this
battle
:
he
needs
the
support
of
those
who
have
faith
in
markets
and
equal
treatment
for
all
.
5 5
The
story
is
simple
.
31 15
The
French
government
plans
to
bail
out
Alstom
,
a
company
that
has
developed
high-tech
products
,
including
the
TGV
,
the
French
high-speed
train
,
but
recently
is
bankrupt
.
33 19
The
French
government
proclaims
that
he
will
never
abandon
his
plan
to
rescue
Alstom
,
a
plan
that
has
all
the
usual
dirigiste
motivations
:
maintaining
employment
,
protecting
investors
,
etc.
.
32 10
Moreover
,
insofar
Alstom
is
a
high-tech
enterprise
,
the
French
government
opts
for
research
and
development
,
arguing
that
investment
in
R
\
x26amp
;
D
is
beneficial
to
growth
.
10 6
Save
Alstom
nationalizing
the
company
is
obviously
a
mistake
.
23 10
The
company
is
comprised
of
different
units
,
some
beneficial
,
others
bankruptcy
:
it
is
obvious
that
it
should
be
dismantled
.
19 7
The
profitable
units
,
such
as
the
TGV
,
easily
find
buyer
;
deficit
units
must
be
closed
.
27 11
The
French
taxpayers
'
money
will
be
better
spent
in
the
temporary
costs
of
retraining
employees
rather
than
keep
alive
a
company
that
is
not
profitable
.
32 20
It
is
important
that
the
European
Commission
does
not
allow
France
to
carve
laws
made
for
itself
in
competition
policy
,
as
it
seems
to
be
doing
it
with
budget
deficits
.
23 11
The
Commission
must
order
the
public
financing
of
private
enterprises
in
France
just
as
it
condemns
subsidies
in
other
European
Member
State
.
23 13
The
Commission
has
already
achieved
some
success
in
that
area
,
especially
by
forcing
Germany
to
cancel
government
guarantees
for
public
banks
.
19 7
Alstom
in
particular
and
France
in
general
should
not
be
an
exception
and
must
meet
the
same
standards
.
21 9
If
the
Commission
does
not
react
,
the
European
Union
will
look
even
more
like
a
playground
for
French
officials
.
37 15
France
has
already
taken
the
lead
in
the
foreign
policy
of
the
European
Union
with
its
foreign
minister
,
Dominique
de
Villepin
,
who
acts
and
looks
more
and
more
like
a
foreign
minister
of
Europe
.
20 8
At
the
same
time
,
France
ignores
vital
regulation
of
common
economic
policy
and
government
support
for
private
companies
.
22 17
The
European
Commission
she
will
lose
what
little
credibility
he
has
left
to
end
up
looking
like
a
Parisian
arrondissement
smaller
?
19 9
Losing
on
the
question
of
Alstom
would
have
serious
repercussions
in
Europe
and
not
only
for
competition
policy
.
43 11
War
oil
for
decades
,
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
have
the
same
objectives
in
the
oil
industry
:
maintain
as
possible
the
stability
of
oil
prices
,
smoothly
reduce
domestic
consumption
,
reduce
dependence
related
imports
and
diversify
foreign
sources
of
supply
.
15 6
Despite
appearances
,
these
goals
are
still
the
same
today
under
the
Bush
administration
.
16 10
Many
observers
believe
that
with
the
invasion
of
Iraq
,
Bush
chose
a
different
path
.
14 7
A
significant
increase
in
Iraqi
production
would
likely
increase
U.S.
dependence
on
oil
.
28 17
The
price
of
oil
will
fall
probably
with
the
emergence
of
a
new
source
of
supply
,
which
increased
U.S.
dependence
,
especially
vis-à-vis
the
Middle
East
.
62 22
It
is
ironic
that
the
U.S.
exercised
more
control
over
Iraqi
oil
under
the
``
oil
against
food
''
program
of
the
United
Nations
before
the
war
-LRB-
it
was
then
the
UN
and
not
Saddam
Hussein
who
was
staring
at
the
level
of
Iraqi
exports
-RRB-
they
can
not
do
so
in
the
context
of
a
future
democratic
Iraqi
state
.
40 13
If
the
Bush
administration
was
looking
for
sources
of
oil
supply
stable
,
safe
,
diverse
and
cheap
,
it
was
enough
to
lift
the
embargo
imposed
on
Libya
,
Iran
,
Iraq
and
Sudan
and
allow
flowing
oil
.
17 8
But
the
interest
of
America
to
Iraqi
oil
is
not
dictated
by
economics
or
energy
policy
.
14 9
The
Bush
administration
has
acknowledged
that
Iraqi
oil
is
primarily
a
geopolitical
asset
.
7 7
Who
controls
Iraqi
oil
controls
Iraq
.
13 8
Saddam
had
his
power
because
it
controlled
the
second
world
oil
reserves
.
9 8
He
knew
exactly
what
he
was
black
gold
.
18 9
Faced
with
the
possibility
of
invasion
and
defeat
,
he
threatened
to
fire
the
Iraqi
oil
fields
.
24 14
The
destruction
and
looting
of
Iraqi
oil
facilities
and
pipelines
shows
that
virtually
everyone
understood
that
oil
control
is
to
control
the
country
.
17 9
During
the
preparation
of
the
invasion
by
the
U.S.
,
securing
oil
fields
was
a
priority
.
31 11
The
goal
was
not
an
increase
in
supply
or
a
decrease
in
prices
in
the
U.S.
market
,
but
the
overthrow
of
Saddam
and
his
replacement
by
a
new
government
.
13 8
The
future
of
Iraq
is
linked
to
the
country
's
oil
production
.
34 12
But
given
the
vagaries
of
the
oil
market
,
especially
in
a
situation
as
unstable
,
it
is
not
clear
how
the
Bush
administration
fail
to
achieve
its
objectives
in
the
coming
years
.
5 5
The
problem
is
simple
.
20 11
The
U.S.
must
use
oil
revenues
to
alleviate
the
financial
burden
of
Iraqi
regime
change
based
on
U.S.
taxpayers
.
20 10
long
term
,
any
plan
of
reconstruction
depends
on
the
ability
of
Iraq
to
export
large
volumes
of
oil
.
29 12
If
Iraq
does
not
produce
oil
,
President
Bush
can
not
keep
the
promises
he
made
to
the
Iraqi
people
,
the
American
people
and
the
international
community
.
18 11
Before
the
invasion
,
Iraq
had
a
production
capacity
of
three
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
.
19 11
But
he
can
not
return
to
this
level
of
production
in
the
time
to
establish
an
Iraqi
government
.
21 12
Increased
production
requires
the
development
of
oil
installations
,
which
requires
large
investments
,
an
incumbent
government
and
political
stability
.
18 9
Nobody
,
not
even
the
Bush
administration
,
no
one
expects
that
these
conditions
are
fulfilled
soon
.
11 9
Political
stability
is
a
precondition
for
increasing
the
production
capacity
.
31 13
The
experience
of
Iran
,
Kuwait
,
Russia
and
even
Iraq
shows
that
it
takes
about
three
years
of
political
stability
before
production
capacity
may
not
increase
significantly
and
sustainably
.
39 11
will
take
several
years
for
Iraq
to
draft
a
new
constitution
,
establishing
a
democratic
government
,
negotiate
the
distribution
of
oil
revenues
between
the
different
regions
,
regulate
investment
and
make
the
economy
attractive
to
foreign
investors
.
35 14
It
will
also
have
time
to
negotiate
with
multinational
oil
companies
and
neighboring
countries
carrying
out
feasibility
studies
and
technical
studies
needed
as
well
as
reconstruction
,
rehabilitation
and
exploration
of
its
oil
fields
.
34 13
So
even
a
period
of
3
years
seems
optimistic
,
because
it
assumes
that
during
this
time
the
occupation
continues
,
the
Iraqis
establish
their
own
government
and
an
end
to
political
instability
.
7 6
The
reality
may
be
quite
different
.
7 7
Important
voltages
may
exist
for
years
.
20 10
And
it
would
not
be
surprising
that
Iraqi
oil
production
may
stop
suddenly
,
even
with
a
democratic
government
.
24 13
History
shows
that
strikes
and
social
unrest
that
can
disrupt
oil
production
occurs
more
easily
in
a

This
speaks
volumes
about
the

of

that
this
decision
comes
at
a
delicate
moment
for

President
Bush
challenged
the
United

to
demonstrate
their
seriousness
about
their
own
decisions
binding
on
Iraq
:
otherwise
,
they
may
suffer
the
same
ignominious
fate
as
the
League
of

,
which
proved
powerless
in
1930
when
she
faced
the
aggressive
policies
of
Nazi
Germany
and

.

The
election
of
Libya
to
chair
a
United
Nations
agency
responsible
for
enforcing
the
rights
currently
does
little
to
support
the
legitimacy
or
moral
authority
of
the
world
body
.
28 10
Remember
that
Libya
is
a
totalitarian
tyranny
,
its
leader
,
Muammar
Ghaddafi
,
combines
a
sometimes
erratic
behavior
of
extremist
policies
supporting
dictators
around
the
world
.

He
runs
one
of
the
most
tyrannical

in

in
which
there

where
opposing
views
are
instantly
suppressed
.
22 6
Under
his
rule
,
Libya
supported
terrorist
organizations
around

the

During
the
last
decade
,
the
United

position
as
a
symbol
of
the
ideals
of
a

has
been
regularly
undermined

They
have
proved
completely

,
the
Dutch

in

It
is
a
depressing

miserable
past
that
the
UN
is
trying
,
probably
unsuccessfully
,
to
redeem
appearing
in
the
Iraq
crisis
,
as
the
voice
of
reason

international
legitimacy

But
at
a
time
when
the
UN
inspections
in
Iraq
like
sending
the
Army
Hi
to
remove
a
bunch
of
gangsters
,
it
is
possible
that
the
election
of
Libya
to
the
head
of
the
Commission
on
Human
Man
remains
a
historic
date
that
the
final
failure

Organizations
do
not

certainly
,
there
is
too
much
state

for
not

Last
Thursday
,
the
judges
of
the
court
of
central
Jakarta
,
Indonesia
sentenced
me
to
one
year
in
prison
.
52 22
I
am
guilty
,
in
my
capacity
as
editor
of
Tempo
Weekly
Newsmagazine
,
according
to
the
court
,
of
defaming
Winata
,
a
business
tycoon
,
to
have
understood
his
possible
involvement
in
a
fire
in
the
textile
market
in
Asia
South-east
of
Jakarta
and
of
fomenting
riots
spreading
lies
.
18 8
My
case
and
other
similar
cases
portend
they
once
again
after
a
short
experience
in
democratic
Indonesia
?

``
Riot
''
I
fomented
occurred
in
March
last
year
,
when
about
200
thugs
claiming
Winata
raided
the
offices
of
Tempo
,
threatening
to
burn
down
the
building
,
harassing
staff
and
injuring
a
journalist
.
36 12
To
try
to
resolve
the
situation
peacefully
,
I
was
persuaded
to
go
to
the
police
negotiate
central
Jakarta
and
discovered
there
,
horrified
,
as
the
clique
leaders
took
power
at
the
police
station
.
14 11
I
was
struck
by
punches
and
kicks
while
the
police
left
to
do
.
18 8
Fortunately
,
many
journalists
came
to
our
rescue
with
tape
recorders
and
cameras
to
record
these
events
.
17 9
dissemination
of
these
images
sparked
public
outrage
and
forced
the
parliament
to
open
a
public
inquiry
.
29 9
officials
of
the
National
Police
and
the
Jakarta
police
were
called
and
because
of
the
strong
pressure
of
public
opinion
,
the
leaders
of
this
gang
were
charged
.
22 13
However
,
Winata
himself
escaped
the
police
investigation
simply
stating
publicly
that
his
supporters
acted
without
informing
and
without
his
consent
.
23 10
He
sued
himself
thereafter
against
Ahmad
Taufik
,
the
author
of
the
article
,
Teuku
Iskandar
Ali
,
editor
,
and
myself
.
19 15
trial
hearings
,
which
lasted
one
year
were
marked
by
a
series
of
favorable
developments
all
suspects
Winata
.
22 10
Firstly
,
the
case
mounted
by
the
police
and
the
prosecutor
contained
documents
so
clearly
falsified
the
police
indicted
two
officers
.
19 15
But
the
court
rejected
our
request
to
suspend
hearings
to
clarify
the
legality
of
the
prosecution
's
case
.
11 8
The
case
against
the
officers
involved
seems
to
lead
nowhere
.
29 16
Instead
,
one
of
them
was
promoted
to
head
of
the
new
anti-terrorist
unit
in
Jakarta
which
has
been
created
-LRB-
and
funded
by
the
United
States
-RRB-
.
17 14
The
other
is
said
to
have
been
referred
to
the
police
school
to
receive
specialized
training
.
31 11
Then
,
after
six
months
of
hearings
,
the
chief
judge
of
the
panel
of
three
judges
was
suddenly
promoted
to
head
of
a
municipal
court
an
hour
in
Jakarta
.
26 10
One
of
my
lawyers
noticed
in
35
years
of
practice
in
court
,
he
had
never
seen
a
senior
judge
be
replaced
during
the
case
.
20 10
In
fact
,
despite
its
promotion
,
the
judge
continued
to
preside
over
another
case
in
the
same
building
.
