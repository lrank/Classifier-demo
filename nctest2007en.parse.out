Europe
's
Divided
Racial
House
A
common
feature
of
Europe
's
extreme
right
is
its
racism
and
use
of
the
immigration
issue
as
a
political
wedge
.
49 12
The
Lega
Nord
in
Italy
,
the
Vlaams
Blok
in
the
Netherlands
,
the
supporters
of
Le
Pen
's
National
Front
in
France
,
are
all
examples
of
parties
or
movements
formed
on
the
common
theme
of
aversion
to
immigrants
and
promotion
of
simplistic
policies
to
control
them
.
31 11
While
individuals
like
Jorg
Haidar
and
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
may
come
and
-LRB-
never
to
soon
-RRB-
go
,
the
race
question
will
not
disappear
from
European
politics
anytime
soon
.
18 8
An
aging
population
at
home
and
ever
more
open
borders
imply
increasing
racial
fragmentation
in
European
countries
.
30 13
Mainstream
parties
of
the
center
left
and
center
right
have
confronted
this
prospect
by
hiding
their
heads
in
the
ground
,
hoping
against
hope
that
the
problem
will
disappear
.
12 8
It
will
not
,
as
America
's
racial
history
clearly
shows
.
44 16
Race
relations
in
the
US
have
been
for
decades
-
and
remain
-
at
the
center
of
political
debate
,
to
the
point
that
racial
cleavages
are
as
important
as
income
,
if
not
more
,
as
determinants
of
political
preferences
and
attitudes
.
26 13
The
first
step
to
address
racial
politics
is
to
understand
the
origin
and
consequences
of
racial
animosity
,
even
if
it
means
uncovering
unpleasant
truths
.
24 12
This
is
precisely
what
a
large
amount
of
research
in
economics
,
sociology
,
psychology
and
political
science
has
done
for
the
US
.
55 17
This
research
shows
that
people
of
different
races
trust
each
other
much
less
;
whites
are
less
willing
to
support
welfare
spending
because
it
is
perceived
to
favor
minorities
;
more
racially
fragmented
communities
have
less
efficient
governments
,
more
corruption
and
patronage
,
more
crime
and
fewer
productive
public
goods
per
tax
dollar
.
40 15
This
does
not
mean
that
the
answer
is
to
eliminate
heterogeneity
and
create
racially
homogenous
communities
,
but
an
acknowledgment
of
the
reality
of
these
issues
is
needed
in
order
to
start
constructing
solid
public
policies
toward
race
relations
.
11 10
Of
course
,
Americans
disagree
on
how
to
do
this
.
21 14
Some
favor
affirmative
action
programs
that
provide
preferences
for
minorities
in
job
allocation
,
college
admission
,
and
public
contracts
.
31 12
These
policies
are
seen
as
a
way
of
offering
reparation
for
past
injustices
and
,
more
importantly
,
for
creating
role
models
and
for
overcoming
residual
and
perhaps
involuntary
discrimination
.
37 20
Others
object
to
affirmative
action
,
and
argue
that
a
race-blind
policy
coupled
with
free
market
polices
and
pro-family
values
are
all
that
are
necessary
to
create
jobs
for
minorities
and
help
keep
black
families
together
.
39 18
The
latter
is
a
crucial
in
any
policy
,
since
one
of
the
single
most
important
causes
of
poverty
in
the
US
is
the
diffusion
of
single
parents
-LRB-
read
single
mother
-RRB-
households
in
the
black
community
.
24 14
Regardless
of
the
correct
answer
,
the
point
is
that
determining
what
to
do
about
race
is
a
dominant
issue
in
US
politics
.
14 8
Of
course
,
minorities
have
made
progress
towards
more
integration
and
economic
success
.
26 11
In
the
1950s
blacks
could
not
sit
in
the
front
of
busses
,
today
two
of
the
main
players
in
US
foreign
politics
are
blacks
.
20 8
To
be
sure
,
right
wing
American
politicians
continue
deploy
the
``
race
card
''
as
a
tactical
tool
.
23 11
Take
the
case
of
Patrick
Buchanan
the
former
Nixon
and
Reagan
aid
who
became
an
independent
presidential
candidate
in
the
last
election
.
27 10
He
recently
published
a
successful
book
entitled
''
The
Death
of
the
West
:
How
Dying
Populations
and
Immigrant
Invasion
Imperil
Our
Country
and
Civilization
.
''
20 10
But
for
every
book
like
this
there
are
ten
others
with
a
serious
analysis
of
America
's
race
question
.
13 7
Policy
analysis
and
debates
about
race
relations
lag
terribly
behind
in
Europe
.
35 14
At
most
the
question
is
dealt
with
narrowly
,
in
terms
of
immigration
quotas
and
border
restrictions
,
not
in
terms
of
the
social
problems
and
opportunities
created
by
an
increasingly
racially
mixed
Europe
.
19 11
Of
course
,
a
clear
immigration
policy
is
needed
in
order
to
avoid
the
accumulation
of
illegal
immigrants
.
26 10
But
this
can
not
be
the
end
of
it
:
border
controls
with
Mexico
are
not
the
end
of
American
policy
towards
domestic
race
issues
!
35 13
Europe
is
rich
and
rapidly
aging
;
Europeans
,
cushioned
by
generous
welfare
programs
,
are
no
longer
prepared
to
accept
``
dirty
jobs
''
in
,
say
,
agriculture
or
the
leather
industry
.
8 7
This
makes
an
increase
in
immigration
unavoidable
.
28 13
Europeans
,
however
,
are
prompt
to
criticize
the
US
for
any
failure
in
their
policy
toward
minorities
and
for
any
manifestation
of
racism
across
the
Atlantic
.
42 8
Reading
the
European
press
one
often
perceives
a
superiority
complex
towards
the
US
over
racial
issues
:
they
,
the
Americans
,
have
problems
with
racism
;
we
are
immune
from
it
,
except
for
crazed
neo-Nazi
skinheads
and
their
like
.
53 13
What
has
happened
in
recent
weeks
,
from
Paris
to
Amsterdam
,
shows
that
the
race
problem
in
Europe
is
much
deeper
and
,
as
in
the
US
,
stems
from
the
sad
truth
that
race
relations
are
inherently
difficult
and
trust
and
cooperative
behavior
does
not
travel
well
across
racial
lines
.
47 14
If
Europe
's
mainstream
parties
do
not
begin
a
more
serious
investment
in
understanding
racial
tensions
in
Europe
and
put
``
race
''
as
one
of
their
main
priorities
,
individuals
like
Le
Pen
are
bound
to
try
filling
the
void
with
their
message
of
hate
.
30 16
Fighting
the
French
Exception
Europe
's
attention
nowadays
is
rightly
focused
on
enlargement
and
on
the
constitution
that
is
currently
being
worked
out
between
the
EU
's
member
states
.
27 13
But
the
outcome
of
several
Gallic
skirmishes
with
the
European
Commission
will
be
no
less
important
in
determining
the
fate
of
the
new
and
enlarged
Europe
.
25 15
France
has
unilaterally
chosen
to
ignore
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
by
running
a
predicted
deficit
well
above
the
3
%
of
GDP
limit
.
26 11
The
French
like
to
acclaim
the
rational
rigour
of
their
thinking
,
but
where
budgets
are
concerned
,
Descartes
is
out
and
obfuscation
is
in
.
37 15
France
was
among
the
leading
critics
of
Ireland
,
when
,
in
2000
,
the
Irish
government
reduced
its
budget
surplus
,
which
then
stood
at
4
%
of
GDP
,
by
a
mere
0.5
%
.
22 11
Other
countries
have
violated
the
Stability
Pact
,
but
France
is
the
first
to
do
it
with
smirking
,
open
defiance
.
7 6
None
of
this
should
surprise
anyone
.
18 14
France
is
simply
applying
to
EU
rules
its
engrained
habit
of
viewing
its
own
culture
as
exceptional
.
14 7
For
example
,
France
consistently
vetoes
reforms
of
the
EU
Common
Agricultural
Policy
.
36 14
As
even
children
know
,
the
CAP
is
a
handsome
and
totally
undeserved
present
to
wealthy
European
-LRB-
especially
French
-RRB-
farmers
at
the
expense
of
the
struggling
farmers
of
developing
countries
and
EU
consumers
.
25 20
France
is
also
trying
to
return
to
old
policies
of
bailing
out
unprofitable
private
companies
on
the
verge
of
collapse
with
taxpayers
'
money
.
32 14
The
EU
Commissioner
for
Competition
Policy
,
Mario
Monti
,
can
not
loose
this
battle
:
he
needs
the
support
of
those
who
believe
in
markets
and
equal
treatment
for
all
.
6 5
Here
the
story
is
simple
.
34 16
The
French
government
plans
to
bail
out
Alstom
,
a
company
that
developed
a
number
of
high-tech
products
,
including
the
TGV
,
the
French
fast
train
,
but
recently
went
into
bankruptcy
.
34 18
The
French
government
claims
that
it
will
never
back
down
from
its
plan
to
rescue
Alstom
,
a
plan
with
all
the
familiar
dirigiste
motivations
:
maintaining
employment
,
protecting
investors
,
etc.
.
31 12
In
addition
,
since
Alstom
is
a
high
tech
firm
,
the
French
government
plays
the
research
and
development
card
,
arguing
that
investment
in
R&D
is
good
for
growth
.
10 8
Saving
Alstom
by
nationalizing
the
company
is
obviously
wrong
.
25 9
The
company
consists
of
many
different
parts
,
some
profitable
,
others
bankrupt
:
the
obvious
thing
to
do
is
to
break
it
up
.
21 7
The
profitable
parts
,
such
as
the
TGV
,
will
easily
find
buyers
;
the
unprofitable
plants
should
be
closed
.
23 12
French
taxpayers
'
money
is
better
spent
on
temporary
benefits
for
displaced
workers
than
on
subsidies
to
keep
an
unprofitable
plant
alive
.
32 19
It
is
important
that
the
European
Commission
not
allow
France
to
carve
out
special
rules
for
itself
in
competition
policy
,
as
it
appears
to
be
doing
with
its
budget
deficits
.
25 10
The
Commission
must
strike
down
public
aid
to
private
companies
in
France
as
it
strikes
such
subsidies
down
in
any
other
EU
member
state
.
22 12
The
Commission
has
already
achieved
some
success
on
this
front
,
notably
forcing
Germany
to
cancel
government
guarantees
on
public
banks
.
21 9
Alstom
in
particular
and
France
in
general
should
not
be
an
exception
and
should
be
held
to
the
same
standards
.
21 9
If
the
Commission
fails
to
act
,
the
EU
will
look
even
more
like
a
playground
for
French
public
servants
.
31 12
France
has
already
taken
a
leading
role
in
EU
foreign
policy
,
with
Foreign
Minister
Dominique
de
Villepin
looking
and
acting
more
and
more
like
the
foreign
minister
of
Europe
.
19 8
At
the
same
time
France
violates
key
rules
of
common
economic
policy
and
public
aid
to
private
companies
.
20 10
Will
the
European
Commission
lose
what
remains
of
its
credibility
and
end
up
looking
like
a
minor
Parisian
arrondissment
?
18 9
A
defeat
on
Alstom
would
have
profound
consequences
in
Europe
--
and
not
only
for
competition
policy
.
60 16
The
War
for
Oil
For
decades
,
through
Democratic
and
Republican
presidential
administrations
,
America
has
pursued
a
set
of
straightforward
energy
policy
objectives
:
keep
world
oil
prices
as
stable
as
possible
;
reduce
domestic
consumption
of
oil
as
painlessly
as
possible
;
reduce
dependence
on
foreign
imports
whenever
possible
;
and
diversify
the
sources
of
imported
oil
.
14 7
Despite
appearances
,
none
of
these
objectives
has
changed
under
the
Bush
administration
.
25 18
Many
observers
believe
that
Bush
has
set
a
new
course
because
the
invasion
of
Iraq
seems
to
fly
in
the
face
of
these
objectives
.
35 14
A
big
increase
in
Iraq
's
oil
production
would
probably
increase
US
dependence
on
oil
relative
to
other
energy
sources
,
as
world
oil
prices
will
probably
fall
in
response
to
the
additional
supplies
.
22 8
This
,
in
turn
,
would
mean
an
increase
in
US
dependence
on
imported
oil
,
especially
from
the
Middle
East
.
54 16
The
irony
,
however
,
is
that
the
US
exercised
greater
control
over
the
Iraqi
oil
sector
under
the
UN
's
pre-war
``
Oil-for-Food
Program
''
-LRB-
in
which
the
UN
,
not
Saddam
Hussein
,
determined
the
level
of
Iraqi
oil
sales
abroad
-RRB-
than
it
will
in
any
future
democratic
Iraq
.
38 9
If
the
Bush
administration
was
seeking
stable
,
secure
,
diverse
and
cheap
oil
supplies
,
it
could
have
simply
lifted
the
embargos
on
Libya
,
Iran
,
Iraq
,
and
Sudan
and
let
the
oil
gush
.
17 7
But
America
's
interest
in
Iraqi
oil
was
not
driven
either
by
economics
or
energy
policy
.
17 8
The
Bush
administration
recognized
that
,
above
all
,
Iraqi
oil
is
a
critical
geopolitical
asset
.
7 7
Whoever
controls
Iraqi
oil
controls
Iraq
.
16 9
Saddam
's
power
came
from
his
control
of
the
world
's
second
largest
oil
reserve
.
12 9
He
understood
perfectly
the
role
that
oil
played
in
his
power
.
18 9
Faced
with
the
possibility
of
invasion
and
defeat
,
Saddam
threatened
to
burn
Iraq
's
oil
fields
.
26 10
Much
of
the
subsequent
destruction
and
looting
of
Iraqi
oil
facilities
and
pipelines
reflects
the
widespread
realization
that
control
of
oil
means
control
of
Iraq
.
16 9
As
the
US
planned
its
invasion
,
securing
the
oil
fields
became
a
critical
priority
.
30 10
The
goal
was
not
increased
supplies
or
reduced
prices
for
Americans
,
but
stripping
Saddam
of
his
power
and
,
ultimately
,
establishing
and
solidifying
a
new
Iraqi
government
.
13 8
Iraq
's
future
depends
directly
on
the
fate
of
Iraqi
oil
production
.
38 19
Yet
the
vagaries
of
the
oil
business
,
particularly
in
such
unsettled
conditions
,
make
it
hard
to
see
how
the
Bush
administration
will
be
able
to
achieve
its
goals
in
Iraq
within
the
next
few
years
.
5 5
The
logic
is
simple
.
20 13
The
US
must
use
oil
revenues
to
lift
the
burden
of
financing
regime
change
in
Iraq
from
American
taxpayers
.
20 11
All
reconstruction
plans
depend
in
the
long
run
on
the
ability
of
Iraq
to
export
oil
in
large
quantities
.
30 8
If
Iraq
does
not
deliver
its
oil
,
President
Bush
can
not
deliver
on
his
promises
to
the
Iraqi
people
,
the
American
people
,
or
the
world
community
.
16 7
Before
the
invasion
,
Iraq
's
oil
production
capacity
reached
three
million
barrels
per
day
.
23 16
Iraq
will
not
be
able
to
increase
its
production
to
that
level
within
the
time
frame
needed
to
establish
an
Iraqi
government
.
27 13
Any
increase
in
Iraqi
oil
production
requires
developing
the
oil
fields
,
which
means
big
investments
,
a
legal
and
representative
government
,
and
political
stability
.
13 9
Not
even
the
Bush
administration
expects
these
requirements
to
be
met
soon
.
13 7
Indeed
,
political
stability
is
the
main
condition
for
increasing
production
capacity
.
42 14
Historical
evidence
from
Iran
,
Kuwait
,
Russia
,
and
even
Iraq
itself
,
indicates
that
it
takes
about
three
years
from
the
re-establishment
of
political
stability
for
capacity
to
increase
significantly
and
for
those
new
higher
levels
to
be
sustained
.
41 12
Iraq
needs
several
years
to
write
a
new
constitution
,
establish
a
legitimate
and
democratic
government
,
negotiate
the
distribution
of
oil
revenues
among
its
various
regions
,
enact
new
investment
laws
,
and
make
the
economy
attractive
to
foreigners
.
34 11
It
also
needs
time
to
negotiate
with
the
international
oil
companies
and
neighboring
countries
,
to
perform
technical
and
feasibility
studies
,
and
to
reconstruct
,
rehabilitate
,
and
explore
its
oil
fields
.
38 13
So
even
a
three-year
time
frame
seems
optimistic
,
for
it
assumes
that
within
that
period
,
the
occupation
will
end
,
Iraqis
will
establish
their
own
democratic
government
,
and
that
political
stability
will
be
achieved
.
11 8
Needless
to
say
,
the
situation
may
play
out
differently
.
7 7
Tensions
may
remain
high
for
years
.
21 11
No
one
should
be
surprised
,
moreover
,
if
Iraqi
oil
production
suddenly
stops
altogether
even
under
a
democratic
government
.
24 13
History
suggests
that
labor
strikes
and
similar
disruptions
that
can
halt
oil
production
are
a
greater
threat
in
democratic
than
in
undemocratic
countries
.
25 9
If
Iraq
can
not
quickly
increase
its
production
capacity
in
the
next
few
years
,
this
will
hinder
both
US
foreign
and
energy
policies
.
11 8
How
will
the
US
finance
the
long-term
reconstruction
of
Iraq
?
10 10
Who
will
pay
to
maintain
a
fragile
Iraqi
democracy
?
25 11
Can
the
US
sustain
its
occupation
if
it
can
not
provide
food
,
health
care
,
and
other
basic
services
to
Iraq
's
people
?
29 13
These
are
tough
questions
,
and
they
are
fundamentally
unanswerable
until
a
stable
,
democratic
regime
in
Iraq
can
control
and
ensure
a
steady
flow
of
oil
exports
.

Letting
Killers
Guard
Human
Rights
If
it
were
not
so
profoundly
sad
,
it
would
qualify
as
the
sick
joke
of
the
millennium
:
Libya
has
been
elected
to
chair
the
United
Nations
Commission
on
Human
Rights
!
21 8
When
Caligula
appointed
his
horse
to
the
Senate
,
the
horse
at
least
did
not
have
blood
on
its
hoofs
.
22 9
The
procedure
,
of
course
,
was
perfectly
legal
:
the
chairmanship
rotates
every
year
from
one
global
region
to
another
.
17 10
This
year
it
was
Africa
's
turn
to
nominate
the
chairman
,
and
they
nominated
Libya
.
8 5
Only
the
US
and
Canada
voted
against
.
9 5
To
their
everlasting
shame
,
European
countries
abstained
.
25 11
It
is
a
telling
commentary
on
the
moral
bankruptcy
of
the
UN
that
this
decision
comes
at
so
delicate
a
time
for
the
organization
.
52 22
President
Bush
has
challenged
the
UN
to
show
its
seriousness
about
its
own
mandatory
decisions
about
Iraq
:
otherwise
it
may
meet
the
same
ignominious
end
as
the
League
of
Nations
,
which
proved
impotent
in
the
1930
's
when
confronted
with
the
aggressive
policies
of
Nazi
Germany
and
fascist
Italy
.
31 15
To
have
Libya
elected
at
this
moment
to
chair
the
UN
body
responsible
for
human
rights
hardly
helps
support
either
the
legitimacy
or
the
moral
authority
of
the
world
body
.
31 13
Let
us
remember
:
Libya
is
a
totalitarian
tyranny
;
its
leader
,
Muammar
Ghaddafi
,
combines
sometimes
erratic
behavior
with
extremist
policies
,
supporting
dictators
all
over
the
world
.
25 11
He
heads
one
of
the
world
's
most
oppressive
regimes
,
where
there
is
no
pretense
at
elections
and
where
dissent
is
instantly
crushed
.
20 8
Under
his
rule
,
Libya
has
supported
terrorist
organizations
worldwide
--
from
the
IRA
to
various
Palestinian
extremist
groups
.
26 12
It
remains
under
UN
sanctions
for
its
role
in
the
downing
of
a
Pan
Am
passenger
flight
over
Lockerbie
,
Scotland
,
a
decade
ago
.
26 12
In
the
last
decade
,
the
position
of
the
UN
as
a
symbol
of
the
ideals
of
a
peaceful
world
community
has
been
steadily
eroded
.
47 11
It
proved
utterly
unable
to
stop
the
wars
in
the
Balkans
;
and
in
at
least
one
case
--
Srebrenica
--
a
Dutch
UN
peacekeeping
force
stood
by
and
witnessed
the
worst
massacre
in
post-1945
Europe
,
as
Bosnian
Serbs
murdered
around
6,000
defenseless
Muslim
men
.
23 11
A
Dutch
commission
of
enquiry
later
admitted
that
the
UN
Dutch
battalion
was
,
in
fact
,
complicit
in
that
war
crime
.
40 12
In
Rwanda
,
once
the
genocide
started
,
the
UN
official
responsible
for
peacekeeping
operations
ordered
the
evacuation
of
UN
forces
from
the
country
,
leaving
the
field
wide
open
to
the
bloodiest
genocidal
massacre
since
World
War
II
.
9 5
That
UN
official
's
name
is
Kofi
Annan
.
37 19
It
is
a
depressing
,
pathetic
record
,
which
the
UN
is
trying
--
probably
in
vain
--
to
redeem
by
appearing
,
in
the
Iraq
crisis
,
as
the
voice
of
reason
and
international
legitimacy
.
51 17
But
at
a
time
when
UN
inspections
in
Iraq
seem
like
sending
the
Salvation
Army
to
clear
out
a
band
of
gangsters
,
raising
Libya
to
head
the
Human
Rights
Commission
may
go
down
in
history
as
the
definitive
failure
of
an
organization
whose
life
started
with
so
much
hope
.
26 17
Organizations
usually
do
n't
die
--
and
certainly
there
is
too
much
raison
d'etat
to
make
certain
that
the
UN
will
continue
to
hobble
on
.
17 12
But
it
will
be
a
mere
shadow
of
what
it
should
,
and
could
,
be
.
9 5
Today
's
UN
gives
hypocrisy
a
bad
name
.

Authoritarians
at
the
Gate
Last
Thursday
,
judges
at
Indonesia
's
Central
Jakarta
Court
sentenced
me
to
one
year
in
prison
.
49 21
As
the
editor-in-chief
of
Tempo
Weekly
Newsmagazine
,
I
am
guilty
,
according
to
the
court
,
of
defaming
a
business
tycoon
named
Tomy
Winata
by
implying
his
possible
involvement
in
a
fire
at
Jakarta
's
South-East
Asia
textile
market
,
and
of
fomenting
riots
by
disseminating
lies
.
22 9
Does
my
case
,
and
others
like
it
,
portend
the
end
of
yet
another
short-lived
experiment
with
democracy
in
Indonesia
?
45 15
The
``
riot
''
that
I
allegedly
fomented
occurred
in
March
last
year
,
when
almost
two
hundred
thugs
claiming
to
be
Winata
's
followers
attacked
Tempo
's
office
,
threatened
to
burn
down
the
building
,
harassed
staff
,
and
injured
one
reporter
.
33 11
Trying
to
help
resolve
the
situation
peacefully
,
I
was
persuaded
to
negotiate
at
the
Central
Jakarta
Police
Station
,
but
found
to
my
horror
that
the
mob
leaders
controlled
the
station
.
13 9
I
was
punched
and
kicked
as
the
police
looked
the
other
way
.
15 6
Fortunately
,
many
journalists
came
to
our
rescue
with
tape
recorders
and
cameras
rolling
.
17 13
Their
broadcasts
caused
a
public
outcry
,
which
forced
our
parliament
to
organize
a
public
hearing
.
24 7
The
National
and
Jakarta
police
chiefs
were
called
and
,
under
massive
public
pressure
,
the
leaders
of
the
mob
were
criminally
charged
.
22 12
But
Winata
himself
eluded
police
investigation
,
merely
by
claiming
publicly
that
his
followers
acted
without
his
prior
knowledge
and
consent
.
29 15
He
then
filed
criminal
charges
of
his
own
,
against
Ahmad
Taufik
,
who
wrote
the
article
,
Teuku
Iskandar
Ali
,
who
edited
it
,
and
me
.
17 9
The
yearlong
court
proceedings
were
marked
by
a
series
of
suspicious
developments
,
all
favoring
Winata
.
25 13
First
,
the
case
built
by
the
police
and
state
prosecutor
contained
documents
that
were
so
blatantly
falsified
that
the
police
indicted
two
officers
.
22 14
But
the
court
rejected
our
request
that
proceedings
be
delayed
until
the
legality
of
the
state
's
case
could
be
clarified
.
12 9
The
case
against
the
officers
involved
appears
to
be
going
nowhere
.
23 13
On
the
contrary
,
one
of
them
has
been
promoted
to
command
the
newly
formed
-LRB-
and
US-funded
-RRB-
Jakarta
Anti-Terror
Unit
.
15 10
The
other
has
reportedly
been
sent
to
the
police
staff
school
for
advanced
training
.
33 12
Then
,
in
the
sixth
month
of
the
case
,
the
Head
Judge
in
the
three-judge
panel
was
suddenly
promoted
to
become
the
head
of
a
city
court
an
hour
from
Jakarta
.
28 12
One
of
my
lawyers
noted
that
in
his
35
years
experience
at
the
court
,
he
had
never
seen
a
Head
Judge
replaced
in
an
ongoing
case
.
20 10
In
fact
,
despite
her
promotion
,
the
judge
continued
to
preside
over
another
case
in
the
same
building
.
