Europe
's
Divided
Racial
House
A
common
feature
of
Europe
's
extreme
right
is
its
racism
and
use
of
the
immigration
issue
as
a
political
wedge
.
49 12
The
Lega
Nord
in
Italy
,
the
Vlaams
Blok
in
the
Netherlands
,
the
supporters
of
Le
Pen
's
National
Front
in
France
,
are
all
examples
of
parties
or
movements
formed
on
the
common
theme
of
aversion
to
immigrants
and
promotion
of
simplistic
policies
to
control
them
.
31 11
While
individuals
like
Jorg
Haidar
and
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
may
come
and
-LRB-
never
to
soon
-RRB-
go
,
the
race
question
will
not
disappear
from
European
politics
anytime
soon
.
18 8
An
aging
population
at
home
and
ever
more
open
borders
imply
increasing
racial
fragmentation
in
European
countries
.
30 13
Mainstream
parties
of
the
center
left
and
center
right
have
confronted
this
prospect
by
hiding
their
heads
in
the
ground
,
hoping
against
hope
that
the
problem
will
disappear
.
12 8
It
will
not
,
as
America
's
racial
history
clearly
shows
.
44 16
Race
relations
in
the
US
have
been
for
decades
-
and
remain
-
at
the
center
of
political
debate
,
to
the
point
that
racial
cleavages
are
as
important
as
income
,
if
not
more
,
as
determinants
of
political
preferences
and
attitudes
.
26 13
The
first
step
to
address
racial
politics
is
to
understand
the
origin
and
consequences
of
racial
animosity
,
even
if
it
means
uncovering
unpleasant
truths
.
24 12
This
is
precisely
what
a
large
amount
of
research
in
economics
,
sociology
,
psychology
and
political
science
has
done
for
the
US
.
55 17
This
research
shows
that
people
of
different
races
trust
each
other
much
less
;
whites
are
less
willing
to
support
welfare
spending
because
it
is
perceived
to
favor
minorities
;
more
racially
fragmented
communities
have
less
efficient
governments
,
more
corruption
and
patronage
,
more
crime
and
fewer
productive
public
goods
per
tax
dollar
.
40 15
This
does
not
mean
that
the
answer
is
to
eliminate
heterogeneity
and
create
racially
homogenous
communities
,
but
an
acknowledgment
of
the
reality
of
these
issues
is
needed
in
order
to
start
constructing
solid
public
policies
toward
race
relations
.
11 10
Of
course
,
Americans
disagree
on
how
to
do
this
.
21 14
Some
favor
affirmative
action
programs
that
provide
preferences
for
minorities
in
job
allocation
,
college
admission
,
and
public
contracts
.
31 12
These
policies
are
seen
as
a
way
of
offering
reparation
for
past
injustices
and
,
more
importantly
,
for
creating
role
models
and
for
overcoming
residual
and
perhaps
involuntary
discrimination
.
37 20
Others
object
to
affirmative
action
,
and
argue
that
a
race-blind
policy
coupled
with
free
market
polices
and
pro-family
values
are
all
that
are
necessary
to
create
jobs
for
minorities
and
help
keep
black
families
together
.
39 18
The
latter
is
a
crucial
in
any
policy
,
since
one
of
the
single
most
important
causes
of
poverty
in
the
US
is
the
diffusion
of
single
parents
-LRB-
read
single
mother
-RRB-
households
in
the
black
community
.
24 14
Regardless
of
the
correct
answer
,
the
point
is
that
determining
what
to
do
about
race
is
a
dominant
issue
in
US
politics
.
14 8
Of
course
,
minorities
have
made
progress
towards
more
integration
and
economic
success
.
26 11
In
the
1950s
blacks
could
not
sit
in
the
front
of
busses
,
today
two
of
the
main
players
in
US
foreign
politics
are
blacks
.
20 8
To
be
sure
,
right
wing
American
politicians
continue
deploy
the
``
race
card
''
as
a
tactical
tool
.
23 11
Take
the
case
of
Patrick
Buchanan
the
former
Nixon
and
Reagan
aid
who
became
an
independent
presidential
candidate
in
the
last
election
.
27 10
He
recently
published
a
successful
book
entitled
''
The
Death
of
the
West
:
How
Dying
Populations
and
Immigrant
Invasion
Imperil
Our
Country
and
Civilization
.
''
20 10
But
for
every
book
like
this
there
are
ten
others
with
a
serious
analysis
of
America
's
race
question
.
13 7
Policy
analysis
and
debates
about
race
relations
lag
terribly
behind
in
Europe
.
35 14
At
most
the
question
is
dealt
with
narrowly
,
in
terms
of
immigration
quotas
and
border
restrictions
,
not
in
terms
of
the
social
problems
and
opportunities
created
by
an
increasingly
racially
mixed
Europe
.
19 11
Of
course
,
a
clear
immigration
policy
is
needed
in
order
to
avoid
the
accumulation
of
illegal
immigrants
.
26 10
But
this
can
not
be
the
end
of
it
:
border
controls
with
Mexico
are
not
the
end
of
American
policy
towards
domestic
race
issues
!
35 13
Europe
is
rich
and
rapidly
aging
;
Europeans
,
cushioned
by
generous
welfare
programs
,
are
no
longer
prepared
to
accept
``
dirty
jobs
''
in
,
say
,
agriculture
or
the
leather
industry
.
8 7
This
makes
an
increase
in
immigration
unavoidable
.
28 13
Europeans
,
however
,
are
prompt
to
criticize
the
US
for
any
failure
in
their
policy
toward
minorities
and
for
any
manifestation
of
racism
across
the
Atlantic
.
42 8
Reading
the
European
press
one
often
perceives
a
superiority
complex
towards
the
US
over
racial
issues
:
they
,
the
Americans
,
have
problems
with
racism
;
we
are
immune
from
it
,
except
for
crazed
neo-Nazi
skinheads
and
their
like
.
53 13
What
has
happened
in
recent
weeks
,
from
Paris
to
Amsterdam
,
shows
that
the
race
problem
in
Europe
is
much
deeper
and
,
as
in
the
US
,
stems
from
the
sad
truth
that
race
relations
are
inherently
difficult
and
trust
and
cooperative
behavior
does
not
travel
well
across
racial
lines
.
47 14
If
Europe
's
mainstream
parties
do
not
begin
a
more
serious
investment
in
understanding
racial
tensions
in
Europe
and
put
``
race
''
as
one
of
their
main
priorities
,
individuals
like
Le
Pen
are
bound
to
try
filling
the
void
with
their
message
of
hate
.
30 16
Fighting
the
French
Exception
Europe
's
attention
nowadays
is
rightly
focused
on
enlargement
and
on
the
constitution
that
is
currently
being
worked
out
between
the
EU
's
member
states
.
27 13
But
the
outcome
of
several
Gallic
skirmishes
with
the
European
Commission
will
be
no
less
important
in
determining
the
fate
of
the
new
and
enlarged
Europe
.
25 15
France
has
unilaterally
chosen
to
ignore
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
by
running
a
predicted
deficit
well
above
the
3
%
of
GDP
limit
.
26 11
The
French
like
to
acclaim
the
rational
rigour
of
their
thinking
,
but
where
budgets
are
concerned
,
Descartes
is
out
and
obfuscation
is
in
.
37 15
France
was
among
the
leading
critics
of
Ireland
,
when
,
in
2000
,
the
Irish
government
reduced
its
budget
surplus
,
which
then
stood
at
4
%
of
GDP
,
by
a
mere
0.5
%
.
22 11
Other
countries
have
violated
the
Stability
Pact
,
but
France
is
the
first
to
do
it
with
smirking
,
open
defiance
.
7 6
None
of
this
should
surprise
anyone
.
18 14
France
is
simply
applying
to
EU
rules
its
engrained
habit
of
viewing
its
own
culture
as
exceptional
.
14 7
For
example
,
France
consistently
vetoes
reforms
of
the
EU
Common
Agricultural
Policy
.
36 14
As
even
children
know
,
the
CAP
is
a
handsome
and
totally
undeserved
present
to
wealthy
European
-LRB-
especially
French
-RRB-
farmers
at
the
expense
of
the
struggling
farmers
of
developing
countries
and
EU
consumers
.
25 20
France
is
also
trying
to
return
to
old
policies
of
bailing
out
unprofitable
private
companies
on
the
verge
of
collapse
with
taxpayers
'
money
.
32 14
The
EU
Commissioner
for
Competition
Policy
,
Mario
Monti
,
can
not
loose
this
battle
:
he
needs
the
support
of
those
who
believe
in
markets
and
equal
treatment
for
all
.
6 5
Here
the
story
is
simple
.
34 16
The
French
government
plans
to
bail
out
Alstom
,
a
company
that
developed
a
number
of
high-tech
products
,
including
the
TGV
,
the
French
fast
train
,
but
recently
went
into
bankruptcy
.
34 18
The
French
government
claims
that
it
will
never
back
down
from
its
plan
to
rescue
Alstom
,
a
plan
with
all
the
familiar
dirigiste
motivations
:
maintaining
employment
,
protecting
investors
,
etc.
.
31 12
In
addition
,
since
Alstom
is
a
high
tech
firm
,
the
French
government
plays
the
research
and
development
card
,
arguing
that
investment
in
R&D
is
good
for
growth
.
10 8
Saving
Alstom
by
nationalizing
the
company
is
obviously
wrong
.
25 9
The
company
consists
of
many
different
parts
,
some
profitable
,
others
bankrupt
:
the
obvious
thing
to
do
is
to
break
it
up
.
21 7
The
profitable
parts
,
such
as
the
TGV
,
will
easily
find
buyers
;
the
unprofitable
plants
should
be
closed
.
23 12
French
taxpayers
'
money
is
better
spent
on
temporary
benefits
for
displaced
workers
than
on
subsidies
to
keep
an
unprofitable
plant
alive
.
32 19
It
is
important
that
the
European
Commission
not
allow
France
to
carve
out
special
rules
for
itself
in
competition
policy
,
as
it
appears
to
be
doing
with
its
budget
deficits
.
25 10
The
Commission
must
strike
down
public
aid
to
private
companies
in
France
as
it
strikes
such
subsidies
down
in
any
other
EU
member
state
.
22 12
The
Commission
has
already
achieved
some
success
on
this
front
,
notably
forcing
Germany
to
cancel
government
guarantees
on
public
banks
.
21 9
Alstom
in
particular
and
France
in
general
should
not
be
an
exception
and
should
be
held
to
the
same
standards
.
21 9
If
the
Commission
fails
to
act
,
the
EU
will
look
even
more
like
a
playground
for
French
public
servants
.
31 12
France
has
already
taken
a
leading
role
in
EU
foreign
policy
,
with
Foreign
Minister
Dominique
de
Villepin
looking
and
acting
more
and
more
like
the
foreign
minister
of
Europe
.
19 8
At
the
same
time
France
violates
key
rules
of
common
economic
policy
and
public
aid
to
private
companies
.
20 10
Will
the
European
Commission
lose
what
remains
of
its
credibility
and
end
up
looking
like
a
minor
Parisian
arrondissment
?
18 9
A
defeat
on
Alstom
would
have
profound
consequences
in
Europe
--
and
not
only
for
competition
policy
.
60 16
The
War
for
Oil
For
decades
,
through
Democratic
and
Republican
presidential
administrations
,
America
has
pursued
a
set
of
straightforward
energy
policy
objectives
:
keep
world
oil
prices
as
stable
as
possible
;
reduce
domestic
consumption
of
oil
as
painlessly
as
possible
;
reduce
dependence
on
foreign
imports
whenever
possible
;
and
diversify
the
sources
of
imported
oil
.
14 7
Despite
appearances
,
none
of
these
objectives
has
changed
under
the
Bush
administration
.
25 18
Many
observers
believe
that
Bush
has
set
a
new
course
because
the
invasion
of
Iraq
seems
to
fly
in
the
face
of
these
objectives
.
35 14
A
big
increase
in
Iraq
's
oil
production
would
probably
increase
US
dependence
on
oil
relative
to
other
energy
sources
,
as
world
oil
prices
will
probably
fall
in
response
to
the
additional
supplies
.
22 8
This
,
in
turn
,
would
mean
an
increase
in
US
dependence
on
imported
oil
,
especially
from
the
Middle
East
.
54 16
The
irony
,
however
,
is
that
the
US
exercised
greater
control
over
the
Iraqi
oil
sector
under
the
UN
's
pre-war
``
Oil-for-Food
Program
''
-LRB-
in
which
the
UN
,
not
Saddam
Hussein
,
determined
the
level
of
Iraqi
oil
sales
abroad
-RRB-
than
it
will
in
any
future
democratic
Iraq
.
38 9
If
the
Bush
administration
was
seeking
stable
,
secure
,
diverse
and
cheap
oil
supplies
,
it
could
have
simply
lifted
the
embargos
on
Libya
,
Iran
,
Iraq
,
and
Sudan
and
let
the
oil
gush
.
17 7
But
America
's
interest
in
Iraqi
oil
was
not
driven
either
by
economics
or
energy
policy
.
17 8
The
Bush
administration
recognized
that
,
above
all
,
Iraqi
oil
is
a
critical
geopolitical
asset
.
7 7
Whoever
controls
Iraqi
oil
controls
Iraq
.
16 9
Saddam
's
power
came
from
his
control
of
the
world
's
second
largest
oil
reserve
.
12 9
He
understood
perfectly
the
role
that
oil
played
in
his
power
.
18 9
Faced
with
the
possibility
of
invasion
and
defeat
,
Saddam
threatened
to
burn
Iraq
's
oil
fields
.
26 10
Much
of
the
subsequent
destruction
and
looting
of
Iraqi
oil
facilities
and
pipelines
reflects
the
widespread
realization
that
control
of
oil
means
control
of
Iraq
.
16 9
As
the
US
planned
its
invasion
,
securing
the
oil
fields
became
a
critical
priority
.
30 10
The
goal
was
not
increased
supplies
or
reduced
prices
for
Americans
,
but
stripping
Saddam
of
his
power
and
,
ultimately
,
establishing
and
solidifying
a
new
Iraqi
government
.
13 8
Iraq
's
future
depends
directly
on
the
fate
of
Iraqi
oil
production
.
38 19
Yet
the
vagaries
of
the
oil
business
,
particularly
in
such
unsettled
conditions
,
make
it
hard
to
see
how
the
Bush
administration
will
be
able
to
achieve
its
goals
in
Iraq
within
the
next
few
years
.
5 5
The
logic
is
simple
.
20 13
The
US
must
use
oil
revenues
to
lift
the
burden
of
financing
regime
change
in
Iraq
from
American
taxpayers
.
20 11
All
reconstruction
plans
depend
in
the
long
run
on
the
ability
of
Iraq
to
export
oil
in
large
quantities
.
30 8
If
Iraq
does
not
deliver
its
oil
,
President
Bush
can
not
deliver
on
his
promises
to
the
Iraqi
people
,
the
American
people
,
or
the
world
community
.
16 7
Before
the
invasion
,
Iraq
's
oil
production
capacity
reached
three
million
barrels
per
day
.
23 16
Iraq
will
not
be
able
to
increase
its
production
to
that
level
within
the
time
frame
needed
to
establish
an
Iraqi
government
.
27 13
Any
increase
in
Iraqi
oil
production
requires
developing
the
oil
fields
,
which
means
big
investments
,
a
legal
and
representative
government
,
and
political
stability
.
13 9
Not
even
the
Bush
administration
expects
these
requirements
to
be
met
soon
.
13 7
Indeed
,
political
stability
is
the
main
condition
for
increasing
production
capacity
.
42 14
Historical
evidence
from
Iran
,
Kuwait
,
Russia
,
and
even
Iraq
itself
,
indicates
that
it
takes
about
three
years
from
the
re-establishment
of
political
stability
for
capacity
to
increase
significantly
and
for
those
new
higher
levels
to
be
sustained
.
41 12
Iraq
needs
several
years
to
write
a
new
constitution
,
establish
a
legitimate
and
democratic
government
,
negotiate
the
distribution
of
oil
revenues
among
its
various
regions
,
enact
new
investment
laws
,
and
make
the
economy
attractive
to
foreigners
.
34 11
It
also
needs
time
to
negotiate
with
the
international
oil
companies
and
neighboring
countries
,
to
perform
technical
and
feasibility
studies
,
and
to
reconstruct
,
rehabilitate
,
and
explore
its
oil
fields
.
38 13
So
even
a
three-year
time
frame
seems
optimistic
,
for
it
assumes
that
within
that
period
,
the
occupation
will
end
,
Iraqis
will
establish
their
own
democratic
government
,
and
that
political
stability
will
be
achieved
.
11 8
Needless
to
say
,
the
situation
may
play
out
differently
.
7 7
Tensions
may
remain
high
for
years
.
21 11
No
one
should
be
surprised
,
moreover
,
if
Iraqi
oil
production
suddenly
stops
altogether
even
under
a
democratic
government
.
24 13
History
suggests
that
labor
strikes
and
similar
disruptions
that
can
halt
oil
production
are
a
greater
threat
in
democratic
than
in
undemocratic
countries
.
25 9
If
Iraq
can
not
quickly
increase
its
production
capacity
in
the
next
few
years
,
this
will
hinder
both
US
foreign
and
energy
policies
.
11 8
How
will
the
US
finance
the
long-term
reconstruction
of
Iraq
?
10 10
Who
will
pay
to
maintain
a
fragile
Iraqi
democracy
?
25 11
Can
the
US
sustain
its
occupation
if
it
can
not
provide
food
,
health
care
,
and
other
basic
services
to
Iraq
's
people
?
29 13
These
are
tough
questions
,
and
they
are
fundamentally
unanswerable
until
a
stable
,
democratic
regime
in
Iraq
can
control
and
ensure
a
steady
flow
of
oil
exports
.

Letting
Killers
Guard
Human
Rights
If
it
were
not
so
profoundly
sad
,
it
would
qualify
as
the
sick
joke
of
the
millennium
:
Libya
has
been
elected
to
chair
the
United
Nations
Commission
on
Human
Rights
!
21 8
When
Caligula
appointed
his
horse
to
the
Senate
,
the
horse
at
least
did
not
have
blood
on
its
hoofs
.
22 9
The
procedure
,
of
course
,
was
perfectly
legal
:
the
chairmanship
rotates
every
year
from
one
global
region
to
another
.
17 10
This
year
it
was
Africa
's
turn
to
nominate
the
chairman
,
and
they
nominated
Libya
.
8 5
Only
the
US
and
Canada
voted
against
.
9 5
To
their
everlasting
shame
,
European
countries
abstained
.
25 11
It
is
a
telling
commentary
on
the
moral
bankruptcy
of
the
UN
that
this
decision
comes
at
so
delicate
a
time
for
the
organization
.
52 22
President
Bush
has
challenged
the
UN
to
show
its
seriousness
about
its
own
mandatory
decisions
about
Iraq
:
otherwise
it
may
meet
the
same
ignominious
end
as
the
League
of
Nations
,
which
proved
impotent
in
the
1930
's
when
confronted
with
the
aggressive
policies
of
Nazi
Germany
and
fascist
Italy
.
31 15
To
have
Libya
elected
at
this
moment
to
chair
the
UN
body
responsible
for
human
rights
hardly
helps
support
either
the
legitimacy
or
the
moral
authority
of
the
world
body
.
31 13
Let
us
remember
:
Libya
is
a
totalitarian
tyranny
;
its
leader
,
Muammar
Ghaddafi
,
combines
sometimes
erratic
behavior
with
extremist
policies
,
supporting
dictators
all
over
the
world
.
25 11
He
heads
one
of
the
world
's
most
oppressive
regimes
,
where
there
is
no
pretense
at
elections
and
where
dissent
is
instantly
crushed
.
20 8
Under
his
rule
,
Libya
has
supported
terrorist
organizations
worldwide
--
from
the
IRA
to
various
Palestinian
extremist
groups
.
26 12
It
remains
under
UN
sanctions
for
its
role
in
the
downing
of
a
Pan
Am
passenger
flight
over
Lockerbie
,
Scotland
,
a
decade
ago
.
26 12
In
the
last
decade
,
the
position
of
the
UN
as
a
symbol
of
the
ideals
of
a
peaceful
world
community
has
been
steadily
eroded
.
47 11
It
proved
utterly
unable
to
stop
the
wars
in
the
Balkans
;
and
in
at
least
one
case
--
Srebrenica
--
a
Dutch
UN
peacekeeping
force
stood
by
and
witnessed
the
worst
massacre
in
post-1945
Europe
,
as
Bosnian
Serbs
murdered
around
6,000
defenseless
Muslim
men
.
23 11
A
Dutch
commission
of
enquiry
later
admitted
that
the
UN
Dutch
battalion
was
,
in
fact
,
complicit
in
that
war
crime
.
40 12
In
Rwanda
,
once
the
genocide
started
,
the
UN
official
responsible
for
peacekeeping
operations
ordered
the
evacuation
of
UN
forces
from
the
country
,
leaving
the
field
wide
open
to
the
bloodiest
genocidal
massacre
since
World
War
II
.
9 5
That
UN
official
's
name
is
Kofi
Annan
.
37 19
It
is
a
depressing
,
pathetic
record
,
which
the
UN
is
trying
--
probably
in
vain
--
to
redeem
by
appearing
,
in
the
Iraq
crisis
,
as
the
voice
of
reason
and
international
legitimacy
.
51 17
But
at
a
time
when
UN
inspections
in
Iraq
seem
like
sending
the
Salvation
Army
to
clear
out
a
band
of
gangsters
,
raising
Libya
to
head
the
Human
Rights
Commission
may
go
down
in
history
as
the
definitive
failure
of
an
organization
whose
life
started
with
so
much
hope
.
26 17
Organizations
usually
do
n't
die
--
and
certainly
there
is
too
much
raison
d'etat
to
make
certain
that
the
UN
will
continue
to
hobble
on
.
17 12
But
it
will
be
a
mere
shadow
of
what
it
should
,
and
could
,
be
.
9 5
Today
's
UN
gives
hypocrisy
a
bad
name
.
22 7
Authoritarians
at
the
Gate
Last
Thursday
,
judges
at
Indonesia
's
Central
Jakarta
Court
sentenced
me
to
one
year
in
prison
.
49 21
As
the
editor-in-chief
of
Tempo
Weekly
Newsmagazine
,
I
am
guilty
,
according
to
the
court
,
of
defaming
a
business
tycoon
named
Tomy
Winata
by
implying
his
possible
involvement
in
a
fire
at
Jakarta
's
South-East
Asia
textile
market
,
and
of
fomenting
riots
by
disseminating
lies
.
22 9
Does
my
case
,
and
others
like
it
,
portend
the
end
of
yet
another
short-lived
experiment
with
democracy
in
Indonesia
?
45 15
The
``
riot
''
that
I
allegedly
fomented
occurred
in
March
last
year
,
when
almost
two
hundred
thugs
claiming
to
be
Winata
's
followers
attacked
Tempo
's
office
,
threatened
to
burn
down
the
building
,
harassed
staff
,
and
injured
one
reporter
.
33 11
Trying
to
help
resolve
the
situation
peacefully
,
I
was
persuaded
to
negotiate
at
the
Central
Jakarta
Police
Station
,
but
found
to
my
horror
that
the
mob
leaders
controlled
the
station
.
13 9
I
was
punched
and
kicked
as
the
police
looked
the
other
way
.
15 6
Fortunately
,
many
journalists
came
to
our
rescue
with
tape
recorders
and
cameras
rolling
.
17 13
Their
broadcasts
caused
a
public
outcry
,
which
forced
our
parliament
to
organize
a
public
hearing
.
24 7
The
National
and
Jakarta
police
chiefs
were
called
and
,
under
massive
public
pressure
,
the
leaders
of
the
mob
were
criminally
charged
.
22 12
But
Winata
himself
eluded
police
investigation
,
merely
by
claiming
publicly
that
his
followers
acted
without
his
prior
knowledge
and
consent
.
29 15
He
then
filed
criminal
charges
of
his
own
,
against
Ahmad
Taufik
,
who
wrote
the
article
,
Teuku
Iskandar
Ali
,
who
edited
it
,
and
me
.
17 9
The
yearlong
court
proceedings
were
marked
by
a
series
of
suspicious
developments
,
all
favoring
Winata
.
25 13
First
,
the
case
built
by
the
police
and
state
prosecutor
contained
documents
that
were
so
blatantly
falsified
that
the
police
indicted
two
officers
.
22 14
But
the
court
rejected
our
request
that
proceedings
be
delayed
until
the
legality
of
the
state
's
case
could
be
clarified
.
12 9
The
case
against
the
officers
involved
appears
to
be
going
nowhere
.
23 13
On
the
contrary
,
one
of
them
has
been
promoted
to
command
the
newly
formed
-LRB-
and
US-funded
-RRB-
Jakarta
Anti-Terror
Unit
.
15 10
The
other
has
reportedly
been
sent
to
the
police
staff
school
for
advanced
training
.
33 12
Then
,
in
the
sixth
month
of
the
case
,
the
Head
Judge
in
the
three-judge
panel
was
suddenly
promoted
to
become
the
head
of
a
city
court
an
hour
from
Jakarta
.
28 12
One
of
my
lawyers
noted
that
in
his
35
years
experience
at
the
court
,
he
had
never
seen
a
Head
Judge
replaced
in
an
ongoing
case
.
20 10
In
fact
,
despite
her
promotion
,
the
judge
continued
to
preside
over
another
case
in
the
same
building
.
17 13
A
judge
who
had
previously
ruled
against
Tempo
in
Winata
's
civil
suit
filled
her
vacancy
.
17 12
Finally
,
when
Winata
testified
,
he
perjured
himself
by
denying
that
Tempo
had
interviewed
him
.
61 13
A
recording
of
the
telephone
interview
was
played
in
court
;
sworn
testimony
was
heard
from
the
reporter
who
conducted
the
interview
and
from
two
editors
who
witnessed
it
;
the
official
record
from
the
telephone
company
was
submitted
as
evidence
of
the
call
;
and
an
expert
witness
concluded
that
the
voice
on
the
recording
belonged
to
Tomy
Winata
.
29 14
But
the
judges
denied
Tempo
's
request
that
Winata
be
arrested
and
tried
for
perjury
,
telling
us
to
report
it
to
the
police
,
which
we
did
.
22 8
The
judges
then
denied
our
request
for
a
postponement
of
the
court
decision
until
Mr.
Winata
's
perjury
case
was
resolved
.
15 6
Given
such
flawed
proceedings
,
my
conviction
and
prison
sentence
come
as
no
surprise
.
20 11
But
I
remain
hopeful
that
we
will
prevail
in
the
end
,
when
higher
courts
hear
Tempo
's
appeal
.
26 8
Indonesia
's
courts
are
cleaner
at
the
top
,
and
the
Head
of
the
Supreme
Court
is
a
staunch
advocate
of
democracy
and
press
freedom
.
28 9
Tempo
's
case
could
become
a
landmark
victory
for
our
democracy
,
like
the
US
Supreme
Court
's
famous
decision
in
The
New
York
Times
v.
Sullivan
.
20 10
By
raising
the
bar
for
defamation
charges
,
that
decision
ensures
that
American
journalists
can
hold
public
officials
accountable
.
31 11
No
country
knows
better
than
Indonesia
that
free
speech
and
a
free
press
are
proven
indicators
of
democratic
development
,
and
that
criminalizing
journalists
is
an
early
symptom
of
authoritarianism
.
28 13
Indonesia
was
a
liberal
democracy
in
the
1950
's
,
before
President
Sukarno
,
supported
by
the
military
,
began
a
crackdown
on
the
press
in
1956
.
26 10
With
critical
voices
silenced
,
consolidating
unchecked
power
became
easier
and
,
in
July
1959
,
Sukarno
decreed
the
beginning
of
``
Guided
Democracy
.
''
34 9
For
the
first
few
years
after
Sukarno
's
fall
in
1966
,
all
the
benefits
of
genuine
democracy
,
including
freedom
of
the
press
,
were
restored
-LRB-
except
for
the
communists
-RRB-
.
24 8
But
President
Suharto
's
regime
began
another
press
crackdown
in
the
early
1970
's
,
ultimately
banning
various
media
and
jailing
many
journalists
.
18 7
With
the
press
under
control
,
other
political
rights
were
quickly
curtailed
and
Indonesian
democracy
failed
again
.
27 9
Since
Suharto
's
fall
in
1998
,
Indonesia
has
become
the
third
largest
democratic
country
in
the
world
and
the
largest
democratic
Muslim
community
in
history
.
32 11
Two
parliamentary
elections
and
two
direct
presidential
elections
-
including
the
latest
presidential
run-off
-
have
been
free
,
fair
,
and
peaceful
,
proving
that
Islam
and
democracy
can
coexist
.
9 5
Democracy
's
enemies
,
however
,
never
rest
.
25 12
Radical
Islamic
groups
have
engaged
in
indiscriminate
bombings
,
while
groups
with
strong
authoritarian
tendencies
have
made
inroads
into
President
Megawati
's
inner
circle
.
13 10
But
Mrs
Megawati
has
just
been
defeated
in
her
bid
for
reelection
.
10 8
Will
newly
elected
President
Susilo
continue
to
prosecute
journalists
?
26 10
Will
my
conviction
,
and
the
trials
and
convictions
of
other
journalists
,
mark
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
Indonesia
's
hard-won
third
democracy
?
16 10
The
answer
lies
in
the
support
that
Indonesian
pro-democracy
activists
can
generate
domestically
and
internationally
.
25 14
To
lose
Indonesia
-
a
potential
beacon
of
hope
to
all
pro-democracy
activists
in
the
world
Muslim
community
-
would
be
a
terrible
defeat
.
18 11
The
Morality
of
Capital
Punishment
The
US
is
often
criticized
for
its
refusal
to
abolish
capital
punishment
.
17 10
Many
now
claim
that
abolition
of
capital
punishment
is
a
precondition
of
a
civilized
criminal-law
system
.
6 4
Nobel
laureate
Gary
Becker
disagrees
.
28 8
European
governments
are
adamantly
opposed
to
capital
punishment
--
the
European
Union
bans
it
outright
--
and
some
Europeans
consider
its
use
in
the
United
States
barbaric
.
22 10
Indeed
,
many
European
intellectuals
argue
that
not
just
capital
punishment
,
but
punishment
in
general
,
does
not
deter
criminals
.
44 14
But
,
whereas
Europeans
,
with
crime
rates
well
below
American
rates
for
the
past
half-century
,
could
long
afford
to
be
relatively
``
soft
''
on
most
crimes
,
they
have
seen
their
crime
rates
increase
sharply
during
the
past
twenty
years
.
17 11
By
contrast
,
American
rates
have
fallen
,
in
part
because
of
greater
use
of
punishment
.
5 5
This
includes
capital
punishment
.
22 14
I
support
executing
some
people
convicted
of
murder
because
--
and
only
because
--
I
believe
that
it
deters
other
murders
.
28 12
If
I
did
not
believe
that
,
I
would
oppose
capital
punishment
,
because
revenge
and
other
possible
motives
should
not
be
a
basis
for
public
policy
.
27 9
Serious
empirical
research
on
capital
punishment
in
the
US
began
with
a
pioneering
study
by
Isaac
Ehrlich
,
published
in
1975
in
the
American
Economic
Review
.
21 11
Some
subsequent
studies
have
sometimes
found
a
much
weaker
deterrent
effect
,
while
others
have
found
a
much
stronger
effect
.
22 8
The
available
data
are
quite
limited
,
however
,
so
one
should
not
base
any
conclusions
solely
on
the
econometric
evidence
.
17 9
Of
course
,
public
policy
on
any
punishment
can
not
wait
until
the
evidence
is
perfect
.
21 11
But
,
even
with
the
limited
quantitative
evidence
available
,
there
are
good
reasons
to
believe
that
capital
punishment
deters
.
27 15
Most
people
,
and
murderers
in
particular
,
fear
death
,
especially
when
it
follows
swiftly
and
with
considerable
certainty
following
the
commission
of
a
murder
.
23 10
As
David
Hume
put
it
in
discussing
suicide
,
``
no
man
ever
threw
away
life
,
while
it
was
worth
living
.
45 17
For
such
is
our
natural
horror
of
death
...
''
Likewise
,
Schopenhauer
believed
that
``
as
soon
as
the
terrors
of
life
reach
a
point
at
which
they
outweigh
the
terrors
of
death
,
a
man
will
put
an
end
to
his
life
.
37 18
But
the
terrors
of
death
offer
considerable
resistance
...
''
Opponents
of
capital
punishment
frequently
proclaim
that
the
state
has
no
moral
right
to
take
anyone
's
life
,
including
that
of
the
most
reprehensible
murderer
.
16 11
Yet
that
is
absolutely
the
wrong
conclusion
for
anyone
who
believes
that
capital
punishment
deters
.
48 17
To
see
why
,
suppose
that
for
each
murderer
executed
-LRB-
instead
of
,
say
,
receiving
life
imprisonment
-RRB-
,
the
number
of
murders
is
reduced
by
three
,
which
is
a
much
lower
number
than
Ehrlich
's
and
some
other
estimates
of
the
deterrent
effect
.
15 9
This
implies
that
for
each
murderer
not
executed
,
three
innocent
victims
would
die
.
21 13
In
fact
,
the
government
would
indirectly
be
``
taking
''
many
lives
if
it
did
not
use
capital
punishment
.
32 9
Saving
three
innocent
lives
for
every
person
executed
seems
like
a
very
attractive
trade-off
,
and
even
two
lives
saved
per
execution
seems
like
a
persuasive
benefit-cost
ratio
for
capital
punishment
.
24 13
Admittedly
,
however
,
the
argument
in
favor
of
capital
punishment
becomes
less
clear-cut
as
the
number
of
lives
saved
per
execution
falls
.
37 19
But
,
even
if
only
one
life
were
saved
per
execution
,
the
tradeoff
might
still
be
desirable
if
the
life
saved
is
much
better
than
the
life
taken
,
which
would
usually
be
the
case
.
16 12
Many
people
object
to
comparing
the
quality
of
the
life
spared
and
the
life
taken
.
12 10
Yet
I
do
not
see
how
to
avoid
such
a
comparison
.
24 15
Consider
a
career
criminal
who
robs
and
kills
a
victim
who
led
a
decent
life
and
left
several
children
and
a
spouse
behind
.
19 16
Suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
save
the
life
of
an
innocent
victim
by
executing
such
a
criminal
.
23 13
To
me
it
is
obvious
that
saving
such
a
victim
's
life
must
count
for
more
than
taking
the
criminal
's
life
.
27 9
Obviously
,
not
all
cases
are
so
unambiguous
,
but
a
comparison
of
the
qualities
of
individual
lives
must
be
part
of
any
reasonable
social
policy
.
19 13
This
helps
explain
why
capital
punishment
should
be
used
only
for
murders
,
and
not
for
lesser
crimes
.
24 9
When
the
tradeoff
is
between
taking
lives
and
,
say
,
reducing
property
theft
,
the
case
for
milder
punishments
is
far
stronger
.
34 10
Although
severe
assaults
,
including
some
gruesome
rapes
,
may
approach
some
murders
in
severity
,
and
might
conceivably
call
for
capital
punishment
,
I
do
not
support
its
use
in
these
cases
.
15 9
A
powerful
argument
for
reserving
capital
punishment
for
murders
is
``
marginal
deterrence
.
''
42 27
If
assault
were
punished
with
execution
,
perpetrators
would
have
an
incentive
to
kill
their
victims
to
avoid
discovery
-LRB-
which
is
a
major
reason
why
the
severity
of
punishments
more
generally
should
be
matched
to
the
severity
of
crimes
-RRB-
.
24 20
One
complication
is
that
capital
punishment
may
make
a
murderer
fight
harder
to
avoid
being
captured
,
which
could
lead
to
more
deaths
.
38 16
But
,
while
marginal
deterrence
is
important
,
I
believe
the
resistance
of
murderers
to
being
captured
,
possibly
at
the
expense
of
their
own
lives
,
is
really
indirect
evidence
that
criminals
do
fear
capital
punishment
.
13 10
Of
course
,
I
worry
about
the
risk
of
executing
the
innocent
.
24 13
My
support
for
capital
punishment
would
weaken
greatly
if
the
rate
of
killing
innocent
people
were
as
large
as
that
claimed
by
many
.
44 15
However
,
I
believe
that
the
appeal
process
in
the
US
offers
enormous
protection
,
not
so
much
against
wrongful
conviction
as
against
wrongful
execution
,
so
that
there
are
very
few
,
if
any
,
documented
cases
of
innocent
people
being
killed
.
14 10
And
this
process
has
been
strengthened
enormously
with
the
development
of
DNA
identification
.
23 15
Again
,
the
debate
about
capital
punishment
is
essentially
a
debate
about
deterrence
-LRB-
which
may
be
reduced
by
lengthy
appeals
-RRB-
.
29 20
I
can
understand
that
some
people
are
skeptical
about
the
evidence
,
although
I
believe
they
are
wrong
about
both
that
and
the
common
sense
of
the
issue
.
36 20
It
is
very
disturbing
to
take
someone
's
life
,
even
a
murderer
's
life
,
but
sometimes
highly
unpleasant
actions
are
necessary
to
prevent
even
worse
behavior
that
takes
the
lives
of
innocent
victims
.
21 9
The
People
Versus
Putin
I
helped
select
Vladimir
Putin
to
succeed
Russia
's
first
democratically
elected
President
,
Boris
Yeltsin
.
29 16
Because
KGB/Mafia
structures
now
rule
Russia
and
manipulate
the
judicial
system
,
it
is
assumed
that
Yeltsin
wanted
to
handpick
his
successor
in
order
to
avoid
future
prosecution
.
23 14
But
we
who
chose
Putin
were
charged
with
finding
someone
to
continue
Yeltsin
's
reforms
,
not
shield
him
and
his
family
.
26 10
Indeed
,
Yeltsin
was
fearless
,
and
sought
not
his
personal
survival
,
but
the
survival
of
the
democratic
idea
that
he
introduced
to
Russia
.
14 8
Yet
that
idea
is
now
under
threat
because
of
the
successor
we
chose
.
10 9
I
do
n't
deny
my
responsibility
for
supporting
Putin
.
23 8
We
were
n't
close
friends
,
but
he
and
I
worked
together
in
critical
situations
,
and
I
never
doubted
his
sincerity
.
7 7
Putin
acts
according
to
his
convictions
.
29 22
The
problem
is
that
his
convictions
--
including
his
belief
that
Russia
can
prosper
only
if
it
is
ruled
by
a
single
source
of
power
--
are
wrong
.
10 7
This
gross
error
is
leading
Russia
to
political
ruin
.
25 10
Of
course
,
no
one
holds
high
office
without
making
mistakes
,
even
fundamental
ones
,
and
this
is
especially
true
in
tumultuous
periods
.
11 6
Yeltsin
was
no
exception
,
but
he
recognized
his
errors
.
23 9
When
he
retired
on
New
Year
's
Eve
1999
,
for
example
,
he
asked
forgiveness
for
launching
the
war
in
Chechnya
.
29 11
Putin
,
by
contrast
,
seems
incapable
of
recognizing
and
admitting
his
mistakes
,
and
persists
in
a
policy
long
after
its
failure
is
visible
to
the
world
.
20 12
One
of
Yeltsin
's
errors
was
his
failure
to
put
moral
priorities
at
the
head
of
his
reform
agenda
.
11 9
Russia
should
have
repented
for
Stalinism
and
the
gulag
system
.
21 13
The
whole
nation
,
with
no
exception
,
should
have
repented
,
the
way
the
Germans
have
repented
since
1945
.
27 14
This
failure
matters
,
for
it
allowed
Putin
's
unqualified
belief
in
central
authority
to
lead
to
the
recapture
of
the
state
by
the
security
services
.
35 15
Indeed
,
a
direct
result
of
national
repentance
for
the
gulag
era
should
have
been
the
banning
of
the
communist
party
and
the
disqualification
from
political
office
of
those
who
worked
in
the
KGB
.
42 13
Although
such
political
screenings
are
complicated
in
postcommunist
societies
,
where
both
victimhood
and
collaboration
were
so
widespread
--
and
the
lines
between
them
so
often
blurred
--
a
sound
solution
could
have
been
found
,
as
in
the
Czech
Republic
.
22 8
Doing
nothing
left
Russia
's
security
structures
unscathed
and
able
to
make
a
political
comeback
,
which
they
have
now
achieved
.
27 9
The
political
resurrection
of
KGB
structures
under
Putin
,
and
their
efforts
to
silence
dissent
,
has
once
again
turned
Russia
into
a
country
of
defectors
.
35 23
It
is
impossible
to
silence
independent
politicians
and
independent
media
without
choking
off
independent
sources
of
money
,
which
is
why
Putin
's
Kremlin
has
concentrated
its
attacks
on
the
so-called
``
oligarchs
.
''
13 7
Mikhail
Khodorkovsky
's
arrest
and
trial
were
orchestrated
for
precisely
this
reason
.
23 9
By
removing
independent
sources
of
money
,
the
security
services
that
dominate
the
Kremlin
hope
to
destroy
independent
political
life
in
Russia
.
14 7
Without
independent
bases
of
thought
,
a
climate
of
fear
is
taking
hold
.
13 7
But
fear
is
not
only
degrading
;
it
makes
for
poor
governance
.
32 13
Yeltsin
intuitively
understood
that
fear
and
top-down
,
centralized
decision-making
were
no
way
to
rule
a
modern
country
,
and
he
therefore
insisted
on
reforming
relations
between
citizens
and
the
state
.
27 13
Putin
still
does
n't
understand
that
a
centralized
political
system
is
as
incapable
of
comprehending
and
correcting
mistakes
now
as
it
was
in
the
Soviet
era
.
29 14
Not
being
a
well-educated
man
Putin
is
,
in
full
and
deep
sincerity
,
leading
Russia
toward
the
same
disintegration
that
accompanied
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
state
.
7 9
People
are
beginning
to
realize
this
.
45 23
They
see
that
Putin
's
desire
to
create
a
strong
and
effective
modern
state
can
not
be
realized
,
because
a
modern
state
is
governed
not
from
above
,
but
by
an
informed
citizenry
that
forces
its
rulers
to
acknowledge
and
correct
their
mistakes
.
13 9
Putin
,
too
,
also
seems
to
suspect
his
regime
's
impotence
.
36 19
This
is
one
reason
why
Russia
has
become
so
aggressive
with
its
neighbors
,
Ukraine
and
Georgia
,
and
seeks
to
maintain
a
military
presence
in
places
like
Transdniestria
,
the
breakaway
region
of
Moldova
.
25 10
By
throwing
its
weight
around
in
Russia
's
near
abroad
,
the
Kremlin
thinks
that
it
can
convince
Russians
back
home
of
its
omnipotence
.
35 16
Given
the
neutered
debates
in
Russia
,
and
the
Kremlin
's
ability
to
manipulate
elections
,
regime
change
is
the
only
option
left
for
those
who
want
to
preserve
the
democratic
idea
in
Russia
.
8 8
There
is
no
use
holding
onto
illusions
.
37 24
Those
who
oppose
Putin
must
decide
what
they
want
and
declare
that
,
if
the
regime
fails
to
uphold
the
constitution
,
they
have
the
right
to
force
it
to
do
so
by
any
means
necessary
.
19 8
Today
,
the
question
of
power
in
Russia
can
no
longer
be
decided
solely
at
the
ballot
box
.
17 8
As
in
Ukraine
,
Lebanon
,
and
Kyrgizstan
,
it
will
be
decided
in
the
streets
.
15 10
Tax
and
spend
-LRB-
Please
-RRB-
Excessive
taxation
can
dull
incentives
and
hinder
growth
.
9 6
But
too
little
taxation
can
do
the
same
.
12 6
Governments
with
meager
tax
revenues
ca
n't
provide
basic
public
goods
.
30 13
Worse
yet
,
low
tax
revenues
in
poor
countries
often
result
from
defects
in
tax
collection
systems
-LRB-
rather
than
low
tax
rates
-RRB-
that
also
promote
unproductive
enterprise
.
10 7
India
illustrates
the
importance
of
a
well-designed
tax
system
.
19 9
In
Bangalore
,
high-tech
companies
have
built
world-class
campuses
replete
with
manicured
lawns
and
high-speed
data
communication
networks
.
19 8
Outside
these
campuses
,
however
,
lie
open
sewers
,
uncollected
garbage
,
and
roads
in
acute
disrepair
.
21 11
Whereas
technology
companies
instantaneously
transmit
terabytes
of
data
to
remote
continents
,
local
transport
proceeds
at
an
almost
medieval
pace
.
33 12
As
a
result
,
businesses
in
Bangalore
run
their
own
bus
services
,
contract
with
private
suppliers
for
drinking
water
,
and
install
generators
to
protect
themselves
from
interruptions
in
electricity
supply
.
12 9
The
state
ca
n't
fix
the
shambles
because
it
is
broke
.
22 9
India
's
government
debt
exceeds
70
%
of
GDP
,
so
more
than
half
its
tax
receipts
go
to
paying
interest
.
13 8
But
the
debt
is
n't
because
of
excessive
spending
in
the
past
.
26 13
India
's
government
expenditures
amount
to
about
15
%
of
GDP
,
compared
to
an
average
of
around
40
%
of
GDP
in
the
OECD
.
16 7
Rather
,
India
's
financial
difficulties
stem
from
a
badly
designed
and
administered
tax
system
.
15 6
Rates
and
rules
for
personal
and
corporate
income
taxes
appear
reasonable
by
international
standards
.
29 13
Nonetheless
,
India
's
government
collects
income
taxes
amounting
to
only
about
3.7
%
of
GDP
,
about
half
that
in
South
Korea
and
the
other
Asian
tigers
.
20 9
Agriculture
in
India
accounts
for
about
a
quarter
of
GDP
,
but
even
wealthy
farmers
do
n't
pay
taxes
.
26 9
Export-oriented
companies
in
the
software
and
other
industries
enjoy
tax
holidays
on
their
profits
,
although
their
employees
do
pay
taxes
on
their
personal
incomes
.
9 5
Despite
reasonable
rates
,
tax
evasion
is
widespread
.
39 23
Cheating
occurs
because
the
government
has
n't
invested
in
personnel
or
in
the
systems
to
detect
tax
evaders
,
who
rarely
face
jail
time
and
can
often
bribe
their
way
out
of
trouble
when
they
do
get
caught
.
31 11
More
subtly
,
the
evasion
of
``
direct
''
taxes
on
incomes
and
profits
reflects
the
mess
in
the
system
of
``
indirect
''
taxes
levied
on
production
and
consumption
.
26 12
Excise
taxes
account
for
over
60
%
of
India
's
indirect
taxes
,
which
in
turn
represent
the
same
proportion
of
its
total
tax
receipts
.
19 13
The
basic
excise
tax
has
been
fixed
at
16
%
of
the
value
of
a
firm
's
output
.
13 7
Then
there
are
a
variety
of
concessions
,
exemptions
,
and
surcharges
.
27 10
For
instance
a
``
concessionary
duty
rate
''
of
8
%
is
levied
on
categories
like
food
products
,
matches
,
cotton
yarn
,
and
computers
.
29 12
An
additional
``
special
excise
duty
''
-LRB-
SED
-RRB-
of
8
%
is
levied
on
products
that
include
polyester
filament
,
cars
,
air
conditioners
and
tires
.
27 12
An
``
additional
excise
duty
''
-LRB-
AED
,
not
to
be
confused
with
the
SED
-RRB-
is
levied
on
``
goods
of
special
importance
.
''
31 12
Exemptions
from
excise
taxes
are
numerous
and
complex
,
including
businesses
with
total
annual
revenues
of
less
than
10
million
rupees
and
firms
located
in
certain
troubled
or
backward
areas
.
27 11
Overall
,
the
exemptions
fall
under
70
broad
categories
,
subdivided
into
259
entries
,
52
conditions
,
and
7
lists
,
each
containing
numerous
items
.
4 5
Exemptions
invite
abuse
.
25 12
For
a
price
,
low
ranking
officials
,
who
have
considerable
discretion
in
applying
the
conditions
,
can
be
persuaded
to
reach
favorable
interpretations
.
29 15
Goods
taxed
at
high
rates
-LRB-
for
example
,
polished
granite
-RRB-
are
sold
as
goods
taxed
at
lower
rates
-LRB-
for
example
,
as
unpolished
granite
-RRB-
.
16 11
Evasion
of
excise
taxes
is
more
contagious
than
evasion
of
taxes
on
profits
and
incomes
.
35 12
If
one
firm
evades
excise
taxes
,
and
the
tax
rate
is
high
compared
to
pre-tax
profit
margins
in
the
industry
,
its
competitors
also
have
to
cheat
,
just
in
order
to
survive
.
19 7
As
evasion
increases
,
governments
levy
``
additional
''
or
``
special
''
duties
,
inciting
further
evasion
.
7 6
Collections
of
direct
taxes
also
suffer
.
45 13
The
bribe
paid
to
the
excise
tax
collector
for
a
favorable
classification
,
the
difference
between
the
value
of
polished
and
unpolished
granite
,
and
the
under-reporting
of
true
revenues
create
``
black
''
funds
,
which
can
not
be
declared
on
income-tax
returns
.
36 16
In
addition
to
impairing
the
state
's
ability
to
provide
basic
public
goods
,
schemes
to
evade
indirect
taxes
also
discourage
businesses
from
adopting
more
productive
technologies
,
which
requires
technologies
that
involve
large-scale
operation
.
28 13
But
,
because
indirect
taxes
are
more
easily
avoided
by
operating
many
small
units
instead
of
one
large
unit
,
economies
of
scale
can
not
be
realized
.
27 16
It
's
worth
noting
that
in
the
software
industry
,
where
all
units
are
exempt
from
indirect
taxes
,
Indian
companies
do
operate
at
efficient
scale
.
23 12
Could
India
emulate
China
's
example
,
where
the
rationalization
of
indirect
taxes
in
1994
set
the
stage
for
a
great
boom
?

Or
are
coalition
governments
in
a
vigorous
democracy
incapable
of
such
reform
?
16 8
Last
year
India
's
BJP-led
government
introduced
legislation
mandating
sharp
reductions
in
the
budget
deficit
.
17 10
It
then
appointed
a
task
force
to
formulate
the
necessary
changes
in
tax
and
spending
policies
.
28 9
This
July
,
the
task
force
proposed
raising
taxes
-LRB-
rather
than
cutting
spending
-RRB-
,
through
,
among
other
things
,
removing
most
indirect
tax
exemptions
.
14 8
India
's
new
Congress-led
government
,
too
,
seems
to
favor
these
proposals
.
39 21
If
Congress
and
the
opposition
parties
follow
through
,
they
will
go
a
long
way
to
sustaining
the
country
's
economic
growth
and
in
dispelling
the
idea
that
democracies
can
not
do
what
's
needed
to
encourage
development
.

What
's
Wrong
With
Turkey
?
49 17
On
December
16
,
Orhan
Pamuk
,
one
of
Turkey
's
most
famous
writers
,
will
enter
an
Istanbul
court
to
face
a
charge
of
``
insulting
the
national
identity
''
after
he
advocated
open
discussion
of
the
Turkish
genocide
of
1.5
million
Armenians
in
1915
and
1916
.
7 7
Pamuk
faces
three
years
in
prison
.
33 14
Turkey
's
effort
to
fine
and
imprison
those
who
do
not
toe
the
official
line
convinces
me
that
I
was
correct
to
oppose
opening
negotiations
on
the
country
's
European
Union
membership
.
30 12
In
December
1999
,
the
European
Council
granted
Turkey
the
status
of
EU
candidate-member
,
implying
that
Turkey
would
accede
to
the
Union
at
some
future
,
unspecified
date
.
41 20
The
Council
subsequently
asked
the
European
Commission
to
decide
by
October
2004
whether
Turkey
had
sufficiently
fulfilled
the
political
criteria
--
including
democracy
,
the
rule
of
law
,
and
respect
for
the
rights
of
ethnic
minorities
--
for
membership
.
21 14
That
decision
was
one
of
the
last
taken
by
Romano
Prodi
's
Commission
,
of
which
I
was
a
member
.
17 12
Of
its
30
members
,
29
said
that
Turkey
had
fulfilled
the
criteria
sufficiently
to
proceed
.
6 5
I
was
the
lone
dissenter
.
26 14
The
Commission
's
own
report
on
Turkey
,
prepared
by
Günter
Verheugen
,
who
was
then
in
charge
of
EU
enlargement
,
shaped
my
decision
.
22 13
This
report
mentioned
that
in
2003
some
21,870
Turks
submitted
asylum
claims
in
the
EU
,
of
which
2,127
were
accepted
.
26 11
In
other
words
,
the
EU
's
own
governments
acknowledged
in
2003
that
the
Turkish
government
had
persecuted
more
than
2,000
of
its
own
citizens
.
34 13
Meanwhile
,
the
Commission
published
a
progress
report
on
Turkey
that
granted
that
reforms
were
continuing
,
albeit
at
a
slower
pace
,
under
Prime
Minister
Recep
Tayyip
Erdogan
's
mildly
Islamic-minded
government
.
51 10
Yet
the
report
also
presented
serious
misgivings
:
human
rights
violations
,
including
torture
,
continued
;
the
military
's
influence
remained
too
high
;
freedom
of
speech
was
not
universally
observed
;
non-Muslim
religious
and
cultural
minorities
faced
discrimination
;
and
violence
against
women
was
not
opposed
strongly
enough
.
11 9
Not
much
has
changed
since
accession
talks
began
this
October
.
11 7
Beyond
the
current
persecution
of
Pamuk
,
unacceptable
behavior
abounds
.
17 10
In
March
2005
,
the
police
violently
disrupted
a
demonstration
to
celebrate
International
Women
's
Day
.
25 14
In
May
,
the
largest
teachers
'
union
was
banned
for
promoting
the
education
of
Turkey
's
14
million
Kurds
in
their
own
language
.
13 9
Indeed
,
intolerance
goes
right
to
the
top
of
the
Turkish
government
.
29 12
Foreign
Minister
Abdullah
Gül
abruptly
cancelled
a
recent
press
conference
in
Copenhagen
when
he
spied
a
Kurdish
journalist
in
the
audience
and
the
Danes
refused
to
evict
him
.
12 7
Such
actions
and
attitudes
amply
justify
my
dissent
of
October
2004
.
27 10
But
,
even
if
these
shortcomings
were
removed
,
Turkey
should
still
not
be
admitted
to
the
EU
,
because
it
is
not
a
European
country
.
32 10
Christianity
,
feudalism
,
the
Renaissance
,
the
Enlightenment
,
democracy
,
and
industrialization
have
made
us
what
we
Europeans
are
,
but
they
have
not
made
Turks
who
they
are
.
22 15
So
I
am
not
convinced
that
reforms
in
Turkey
implemented
at
the
insistence
of
the
European
Commission
would
continue
after
accession
.
10 9
Indeed
,
I
suspect
that
there
will
be
backsliding
.
28 10
Moreover
,
Turkey
's
accession
would
lead
inevitably
to
that
of
Ukraine
,
Belarus
,
and
Moldova
,
and
perhaps
of
Georgia
,
Armenia
,
and
Azerbaïdjan
.
13 7
The
first
three
of
these
countries
are
certainly
more
European
than
Turkey
.
24 11
Leaving
the
three
Caucasian
republics
aside
but
including
the
successor
states
to
Yugoslavia
,
this
would
mean
an
EU
of
some
35
members
.
8 7
What
sort
of
Union
would
that
be
?
10 7
The
EU
is
not
simply
a
club
of
friends
.
17 12
It
is
based
on
freedom
of
movement
of
goods
,
services
,
capital
,
and
people
.
39 14
The
Commission
,
as
the
guardian
of
the
Union
's
treaties
,
must
protect
these
four
fundamental
freedoms
,
which
means
that
it
must
sometimes
persuade
,
and
if
necessary
force
,
member
states
to
change
their
laws
.
28 12
Alcohol
policy
in
Sweden
,
the
Volkswagen-law
in
Germany
,
and
discrimination
against
foreign
investment
funds
in
France
are
examples
of
cases
that
made
the
Commission
unpopular
.
5 5
But
they
were
necessary
.
20 9
By
the
time
I
left
the
Commission
,
I
was
sitting
on
a
pile
of
1,500
such
infringement
proceedings
.
20 15
In
short
,
EU
membership
entails
having
to
accept
incisive
measures
that
deeply
affect
a
state
's
internal
affairs
.
9 8
That
will
be
impossible
with
such
disparate
members
.
17 10
The
EU
would
fall
victim
to
what
the
historian
Paul
Kennedy
calls
``
imperial
overreach
.
''
7 6
The
EU
would
become
unacceptably
diluted
.
47 16
That
is
why
former
French
President
Valéry
Giscard
d'Estaing
feared
that
Turkey
's
entry
would
lead
to
the
EU
's
breakup
,
and
it
is
why
former
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Schmidt
said
,
``
Accession
of
Turkey
would
be
more
than
the
EU
could
bear
.
''
28 11
But
the
strongest
reason
to
oppose
Turkey
's
accession
is
a
question
of
democracy
:
a
majority
of
the
EU
's
population
simply
does
not
want
it
.
20 6
Bolivia
's
Crisis
,
Latin
America
's
Failure
Bolivia
is
not
a
typical
Latin
American
country
by
any
definition
.
33 11
But
for
Haiti
,
it
is
the
poorest
nation
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
,
and
it
is
even
less
stable
,
with
a
history
of
more
than
two
hundred
coups
since
independence
.
39 13
In
a
region
with
a
strong
indigenous
past
but
a
scattered
and
isolated
present
,
Bolivia
is
,
alongside
Guatemala
,
perhaps
the
only
country
in
Latin
America
where
indigenous
peoples
make
up
a
majority
of
the
population
.
24 12
Its
topography
and
ethnic
distribution
are
generating
autonomist
and
even
secessionist
forces
that
threaten
national
unity
in
more
menacing
ways
than
anywhere
else
.
19 7
And
,
of
course
,
it
is
,
with
Paraguay
,
the
only
land-locked
nation
on
the
sub-continent
.
19 13
So
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
to
extrapolate
Bolivia
's
current
crisis
to
the
rest
of
Latin
America
.
36 8
It
is
far
too
simple
to
generalize
:
institutions
elsewhere
are
much
stronger
,
poverty
--
and
particularly
extreme
poverty
--
have
been
diminishing
,
and
the
battle
over
natural
resources
has
been
largely
settled
.
37 9
Even
in
places
like
Venezuela
,
with
both
huge
oil
reserves
and
a
traditional-minded
nationalist
government
,
the
status
quo
allowing
for
foreign
investment
in
energy
resources
has
survived
nearly
eight
years
of
President
Hugo
Chavez
.
39 13
While
the
existence
of
indigenous
movements
is
a
reality
in
many
countries
,
from
Chiapas
to
``
Araucania
,
''
from
Amazonia
to
Ayacucho
,
nowhere
in
Latin
America
have
they
posed
a
genuine
threat
to
national
integrity
.
40 13
So
Bolivia
is
not
a
premonitory
crisis
;
nor
does
the
hoary
old
``
domino
theory
,
''
to
which
both
Lyndon
Johnson
and
Che
Guevara
subscribed
in
the
case
of
Bolivia
,
seem
valid
or
even
half-way
reasonable
.
19 10
Yet
Bolivia
's
current
crisis
does
point
to
the
``
democratic
deficit
''
that
plagues
Latin
America
today
.
17 8
Elected
leaders
have
fallen
for
one
reason
or
another
in
Bolivia
,
Ecuador
,
and
Haiti
.
28 9
Democracy
is
either
defective
or
missing
in
Cuba
,
Mexico
,
and
Nicaragua
,
and
it
is
threatened
by
one
cause
or
another
in
Venezuela
and
Colombia
.
22 9
None
of
these
cases
are
identical
to
the
others
;
they
include
varying
degrees
of
danger
,
harm
,
or
reconciliation
.
28 23
The
question
is
what
can
be
done
about
this
state
of
affairs
,
which
contrasts
starkly
with
the
encouraging
outlook
that
prevailed
just
a
few
years
back
.
34 10
At
the
last
Organization
of
American
States
assembly
in
Fort
Lauderdale
,
Florida
,
the
United
States
delegation
took
a
good
idea
from
others
and
,
by
its
support
,
essentially
sank
it
.
32 12
The
story
began
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
when
former
Argentine
Foreign
Minister
Dante
Caputo
and
the
United
Nations
Development
Program
were
charged
with
drafting
the
Latin
American
Democracy
Report
.
29 15
They
concluded
that
an
early
warning
system
for
democratic
crises
in
the
region
would
help
generate
action
before
matters
got
out
of
control
,
as
in
Bolivia
today
.
26 12
Caputo
and
the
UN
team
then
convinced
Chilean
President
Ricardo
Lagos
to
take
up
the
initiative
and
to
promote
it
with
several
of
his
colleagues
.
12 7
He
did
,
but
the
initiative
did
not
get
very
far
.
17 7
In
fact
,
The
UNDP/Latin
America
Democracy
Report
,
published
in
2004
,
barely
mentioned
it
.
60 21
The
US
and
the
new
Chilean
Secretary
General
of
the
OAS
,
Jose
Miguel
Insulza
,
resurrected
the
plan
during
the
OAS
meeting
in
Florida
,
but
it
was
shot
down
by
Latin
Americans
'
reasonable
fears
that
the
idea
was
directed
against
Venezuela
,
mingled
with
Latin
Americans
'
anachronistic
fears
of
violating
the
sacrosanct
principle
of
non-intervention
.
20 10
Despite
the
continent
's
failure
to
agree
on
the
principle
,
the
idea
of
an
early-warning
system
deserves
attention
.
27 14
Today
there
may
be
little
that
the
hemispheric
community
can
do
about
the
situation
in
Bolivia
,
and
yet
it
is
fraught
with
danger
for
everyone
.
34 11
Evo
Morales
,
the
leader
of
the
opposition
and
of
the
coca-leaf
growers
,
may
be
an
honest
,
if
misguided
,
democratic
leader
,
but
are
his
followers
untainted
by
authoritarian
desires
?
39 16
Hugo
Chavez
may
not
be
financing
Morales
and
Bolivia
's
other
dissidents
,
but
are
Venezuela
and
Cuba
really
not
tempted
to
meddle
in
the
country
where
Che
Guevara
died
leading
a
guerrilla
war
nearly
40
years
ago
?
42 11
Bolivia
's
Santa
Cruz
business
community
may
not
carry
out
its
threat
to
secede
,
but
will
they
prefer
to
share
their
region
's
oil
and
gas
reserves
with
the
indigenous
highland
peoples
rather
than
with
Brazilian
industrialists
from
São
Paulo
?
25 11
Before
events
reached
these
extremes
,
it
might
have
been
a
good
idea
for
the
OAS
-LRB-
not
the
US
-RRB-
to
get
involved
.
37 19
The
region
continues
to
need
that
involvement
--
on
time
,
on
message
,
and
on
a
proper
democratic
platform
,
one
that
is
distinct
from
both
traditional
US
intervention
and
Latin
America
's
traditional
indifference
.
5 5
The
Decline
of
France
?
18 8
The
French
are
notoriously
sensitive
--
if
not
defensive
--
about
France
's
stature
in
the
world
.
37 12
The
French
state
spends
vast
amounts
of
money
to
propagate
the
French
language
and
French
culture
,
yet
the
French
are
painfully
aware
that
the
global
position
of
their
country
is
not
what
it
once
was
.
77 16
No
surprise
,
then
,
that
during
the
last
presidential
election
,
the
publication
of
a
European
Commission
report
claiming
France
's
economic
rank
among
European
countries
had
fallen
from
3
The
OECD
and
Eurostat
,
the
European
body
in
charge
of
such
data
,
thought
they
put
an
end
to
this
aspect
of
the
debate
by
showing
that
France
,
Germany
,
Italy
,
and
Great
Britain
all
enjoy
roughly
equal
per
capita
living
standards
.
9 6
But
the
broader
controversy
would
n't
go
away
.
38 11
Worried
talk
about
``
French
decline
''
reappeared
with
this
year
's
street
protests
against
pension
reform
,
mounting
disputes
over
fiscal
policy
with
the
European
Commission
,
and
bickering
with
America
over
the
war
in
Iraq
.
23 10
Today
's
best-selling
non-fiction
book
in
France
is
a
polemic
by
Nicolas
Baverez
,
La
France
qui
tombe
-LRB-
Falling
France
-RRB-
.
13 9
Baverez
's
book
is
filled
with
quotations
from
de
Gaulle
and
Napoleon
.
29 10
According
to
the
author
,
France
's
last
great
achievements
were
in
the
1970
's
,
when
the
fast
train
,
the
TGV
,
and
Airbus
were
launched
.
22 13
He
castigates
both
Mitterrand
and
Chirac
for
their
``
common
talent
to
win
elections
and
turn
France
into
a
loser
.
''
16 9
The
book
's
success
is
itself
a
sign
of
a
kind
of
``
malaise
.
''
5 6
But
of
which
kind
?
13 7
Baverez
's
evidence
of
degeneration
is
not
as
convincing
as
he
believes
.
21 9
For
example
,
he
cites
the
draining
away
of
industrial
jobs
as
the
most
glaring
evidence
of
France
's
decline
.
9 7
But
deindustrialization
is
common
to
all
advanced
countries
.
45 11
Indeed
,
France
does
actually
better
than
most
of
its
rich
country
rivals
and
,
unlike
Germany
,
the
UK
,
or
the
US
,
has
retained
the
same
global
market
share
in
the
industrial
sector
that
it
had
in
the
early
1970
's
.
18 9
Moreover
,
according
to
a
better
measure
of
comptetitiveness
,
foreign
investment
,
France
does
very
well
.
29 9
According
to
a
recent
report
by
the
Economic
Analysis
Council
,
direct
investment
in
France
grew
to
60
billion
euros
in
2001
,
almost
twice
that
of
Germany
.
24 9
French
cost
competitiveness
also
improved
-LRB-
by
20
%
-RRB-
in
the
last
three
decades
,
with
higher
productivity
offsetting
rapid
wage
growth
.
18 9
But
the
core
of
France
's
long-run
economic
problems
is
precisely
the
fear
of
losing
industrial
jobs
.
32 10
France
remains
a
strong
industrial
power
in
traditional
areas
such
as
automobile
and
aerospace
industries
,
but
it
is
falling
behind
in
innovative
markets
,
where
smaller
companies
spread
new
technologies
.
38 10
France
,
for
instance
,
spends
only
$
30
billion
annually
on
high

France
has
undergone
a
set
of
critically
important
reforms
over
the
past
two
decades
:
economic
and
financial
liberalization
,
elimination
of
price
and
foreign
exchange
controls
,
the
end
of
credit
restrictions
,
European
liberalization
,
reduced
inflation
and
trade
deficits
,
the
advent
of
the
euro
and
the
forced
globalization
of
the
country
's
firms
.
12 12
The
French
malaise
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
them
.
20 15
France
's
problem
is
that
it
fails
to
recognize
the
new
world
of
which
it
already
is
a
part
.
20 15
French
state
capitalism
is
dead
,
and
France
is
finding
it
hard
to
come
to
terms
with
its
passing
.
37 18
Indeed
,
France
must
be
the
only
country
in
which
a
Prime
Minister
,
Lionel
Jospin
,
feels
obliged
to
apologize
the
day
after
for
saying
on
TV
that
``
the
state
is
not
omnipotent
.
''
26 12
There
are
many
reasons
for
this
French
schyzophrenia
,
but
a
critical
one
has
to
do
with
the
political
game
of
the
past
20
years
.
13 8
Until
1981
,
France
had
a
clear
division
between
right
and
left
.
27 11
Since
then
,
both
the
Mitterand
and
Chirac
administrations
blunted
their
ideological
edge
in
order
to
carry
the
difficult
process
of
adjustment
towards
Europe
and
globalization
.
22 10
A
round
of
``
shock
therapy
''
à
la
Mrs.
Thatcher
two
decades
ago
might
have
forged
a
new
political
consciousness
.
20 10
But
the
consensual
dribbling
out
of
reforms
allowed
the
French
to
live
in
one
world
and
think
in
another
.
43 19
This
is
a
key
reason
for
the
political
cataclysm
that
exploded
during
the
last
presidential
campaign
,
when
the
far-right
leader
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
reached
the
second
round
of
the
presidential
election
,
ahead
of
the
incumbent
Prime
Minister
,
Lionel
Jospin
.
26 10
The
rise
of
the
extreme
left
,
which
gathered
10
%
of
the
vote
during
that
presidential
campaign
,
also
attests
to
this
political
failure
.
40 24
France
needs
a
political
revolution
more
than
an
economic
one
if
it
is
to
come
to
terms
with
reality
,
part
of
which
is
that
``
French
decline
''
is
a
fear
of
the
French
people
's
own
making
.
25 13
The
Value
of
European
Values
Europe
's
leaders
have
revived
the
constitutional
talks
that
broke
down
last
December
in
a
dispute
about
voting
rights
.
18 14
Such
disputes
are
,
of
course
,
subject
to
compromises
,
which
are
likely
to
be
found
.
19 13
What
still
needs
to
be
settled
is
a
clear
understanding
of
what
the
constitution
is
meant
to
achieve
.
12 7
Two
fundamental
principles
have
underpinned
European
integration
:
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
.
18 8
Both
principles
lie
at
the
crossroads
of
philosophy
,
politics
,
economics
,
sociology
,
and
law
.
41 17
For
years
they
have
been
present
in
the
legal
and
institutional
framework
of
the
European
Union
-
in
treaties
,
in
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Rights
-LRB-
which
quotes
them
in
the
Preamble
-RRB-
,
in
the
recent
draft
Constitution
.
15 8
They
are
,
in
short
,
inscribed
in
the
EU
's
history
and
ideals
.
9 5
But
what
do
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
really
mean
?
44 14
Consider
solidarity
,
which
is
open
to
at
least
two
interpretations
:
static
solidarity
,
which
concerns
only
the
distribution
of
income
and
wealth
,
and
the
broader
concept
of
dynamic
solidarity
,
which
concerns
the
production
of
income
and
wealth
as
well
.
46 11
In
the
postwar
history
of
European
integration
,
dynamic
solidarity
was
strong
in
the
first
period
-
that
of
the
European
Coal
and
Steel
Community
-
both
in
its
economic
development
strategy
-LRB-
reconstruction
-RRB-
and
in
the
Treaties
,
particularly
the
Treaty
of
Rome
.
24 11
This
does
not
mean
that
dynamic
solidarity
was
subsequently
suppressed
:
European
Monetary
Union
,
for
example
,
is
an
expression
of
it
.
19 9
Some
countries
did
not
immediately
benefit
from
the
euro
,
but
accepted
it
for
the
sake
of
solidarity
.
14 12
They
were
convinced
that
it
would
have
positive
effects
in
the
long
run
.
22 9
Dynamic
solidarity
,
in
other
words
,
means
favoring
policies
that
foster
investment
,
innovation
,
economic
growth
,
and
employment
.
20 8
However
,
as
GDP
growth
in
the
EU
indicates
,
dynamic
solidarity
has
been
undermined
over
the
last
decade
.
11 7
What
is
particularly
worrying
is
the
research
and
development
lag
.
49 16
Realization
of
the
EU
's
so-called
Lisbon
strategy
,
adopted
in
2000
with
the
promise
of
creating
the
world
's
most
competitive
economy
,
is
threatened
by
a
growing
emphasis
on
static
solidarity
,
reflected
in
high
social
welfare
costs
and
the
high
taxes
needed
to
finance
them
.
26 13
The
primacy
of
static
solidarity
is
due
to
an
aging
population
,
which
,
along
with
slower
growth
,
has
led
to
structural
fiscal
imbalances
.
30 15
One
of
the
biggest
challenges
for
the
future
of
the
EU
is
addressing
today
's
prevalence
of
static
solidarity
oriented
towards
old
people
over
dynamic
solidarity
favoring
young
people
.
25 21
After
all
,
the
Union
can
not
afford
to
permit
current
consumption
to
continue
to
prevail
over
the
investment
needed
to
ensure
future
prosperity
.
24 13
Subsidiarity
is
similar
to
the
concept
of
solidarity
in
that
it
,
too
,
has
two
interpretations
:
vertical
subsidiarity
and
horizontal
subsidiarity
.
26 11
Vertical
subsidiarity
concerns
the
distribution
of
powers
among
different
levels
of
government
and
sovereignty
:
the
EU
,
national
states
,
regions
,
and
municipalities
.
9 6
The
best-known
application
of
this
principle
is
federalism
.
14 7
In
the
European
Treaties
,
we
find
a
clear
expression
of
vertical
subsidiarity
.
16 10
But
is
this
enough
to
encompass
the
emerging
institutional
and
constitutional
settings
of
the
Union
?
19 9
Horizontal
subsidiarity
concerns
the
responsibility
and
freedom
of
human
beings
,
as
well
as
social
and
economic
powers
.
12 8
It
encompasses
the
relations
between
state
,
society
,
and
market
.
19 12
But
society
and
the
market
have
their
own
rights
and
sovereignties
that
are
not
granted
by
the
state
.
12 10
So
the
problem
comes
in
assuring
the
autonomy
of
each
realm
.
34 14
An
example
of
horizontal
subsidiarity
is
the
internal
European
market
,
which
created
a
new
kind
of
economic
freedom
and
increased
competition
between
firms
because
they
are
no
longer
protected
by
national
governments
.
32 16
Horizontal
subsidiarity
means
that
in
both
society
and
the
economic
sphere
,
the
state
can
not
violate
individual
freedom
and
responsibility
,
which
must
be
respected
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
.
31 22
It
also
means
that
support
must
be
given
by
a
``
superior
power
''
whenever
individual
freedom
and
responsibility
do
not
suffice
to
achieve
the
ends
necessary
for
human
dignity
.
25 12
This
support
,
however
,
should
be
implemented
in
ways
that
the
natural
potential
of
individuals
,
society
,
and
the
market
is
promoted
.
39 14
But
that
is
possible
only
when
the
role
of
horizontal
subsidiarity
is
clearly
formulated
,
which
it
has
not
been
in
the
European
Treaties
,
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Rights
,
or
the
work
of
the
European
Convention
.
59 23
In
short
,
solidarity
has
come
to
mean
redistribution
rather
than
growth
-LRB-
which
is
how
today
's
generation
expresses
solidarity
with
respect
to
future
generations
-RRB-
,
while
subsidiarity
has
come
to
mean
the
distribution
of
political
power
,
rather
than
a
careful
delineation
of
the
boundaries
between
the
state
,
civil
society
,
and
the
market
.
13 11
Today
,
both
values
are
defined
in
ways
that
favor
the
state
.
17 10
Indeed
,
focusing
on
market-based
growth
has
often
been
identified
with
the
semi-alien
values
of
America
.
16 8
But
these
values
are
deeply
ingrained
in
Europe
,
and
should
be
brought
out
again
.
36 18
The
EU
should
restore
its
economic
vitality
by
pursuing
a
model
of
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
that
is
more
balanced
in
favor
of
the
market
and
society
,
and
that
reduces
the
state
's
socio-economic
influence
.
57 15
State
institutions
should
deliver
public
goods
-LRB-
like
defense
,
justice
,
and
fiscal
and
monetary
policy
-RRB-
,
society
should
deliver
social
goods
-LRB-
like
culture
,
education
,
and
assistance
to
needy
people
-RRB-
,
and
the
market
should
deliver
economic
goods
-LRB-
which
are
connected
with
profits
,
growth
,
and
employment
-RRB-
.
49 17
In
the
21st
century
,
Europe
must
reconsider
the
value
of
both
principles
-
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
-
if
it
is
to
attain
integration
's
historic
goal
:
the
freedom
and
well
being
needed
to
overcome
the
differences
and
political
divisions
that
incited
tragedy
in
the
20th
century
.
13 10
That
is
the
spirit
in
which
the
European
Constitution
must
be
written
.
15 9
The
Politics
of
Values
The
debate
about
the
American
elections
has
still
not
abated
.
35 15
How
did
President
George
W.
Bush
manage
to
get
three
million
votes
more
than
Senator
John
Kerry
,
and
,
in
addition
,
to
have
a
Republican
majority
elected
in
both
houses
of
Congress
?
17 8
There
is
not
much
agreement
on
the
answers
,
but
two
themes
recur
in
many
explanations
.
4 5
One
is
personality
.
25 16
At
a
time
of
uncertainty
and
threat
,
people
had
more
confidence
in
the
president
they
knew
than
in
the
candidate
who
seemed
unproven
.
6 5
The
second
theme
is
values
.
13 9
People
voted
for
a
set
of
values
rather
than
for
specific
policies
.
33 9
Indeed
,
some
-LRB-
it
is
said
-RRB-
agreed
with
Kerry
's
policies
but
nevertheless
gave
their
vote
to
Bush
,
because
they
felt
``
at
ease
''
with
his
general
attitudes
.
13 7
Clearly
,
the
United
States
is
now
deeply
divided
in
electoral
terms
.
31 8
An
arch
of
blue
-LRB-
Democratic
-RRB-
states
in
the
East
,
North
,
and
West
spans
a
huge
red
-LRB-
Republican
-RRB-
area
in
the
middle
and
the
South
.
13 7
More
than
that
,
the
divisions
are
reproduced
at
the
local
level
.
19 10
Gerrymandering
--
the
drawing
of
electoral
boundaries
to
benefit
a
particular
political
party
--
is
no
longer
necessary
.
22 15
People
actually
tend
to
move
to
areas
in
which
a
majority
of
others
share
their
values
,
whether
Republican
or
Democratic
.
6 5
What
exactly
are
these
values
?
20 8
They
have
to
do
,
or
so
we
hear
,
with
``
god
,
guns
,
and
gays
.
''
24 16
Religion
plays
a
part
in
them
,
including
the
literal
truth
of
the
bible
when
it
comes
to
the
story
of
the
creation
.
21 8
The
possession
of
a
gun
is
the
ultimate
test
of
individualism
,
and
using
guns
in
wars
is
not
abhorrent
.
12 7
Gays
and
other
``
modern
''
practices
are
rejected
as
self-indulgent
.
35 16
As
the
political
scientist
Andrew
Hacker
recently
put
it
,
``
the
Bush
candidacy
was
framed
to
make
a
majority
by
giving
some
60
million
people
a
chance
to
feel
good
about
themselves
.
''
14 6
Is
all
this
an
American
phenomenon
,
or
are
there
similar
trends
elsewhere
?
27 10
One
answer
is
that
as
an
American
phenomenon
,
the
politics
of
values
may
command
a
majority
now
,
but
it
is
by
no
means
general
.
11 7
Europe
and
other
parts
of
the
world
are
equally
divided
.
25 18
Personality
undoubtedly
matters
,
and
beneath
overt
political
differences
there
may
also
be
issues
of
values
that
have
not
yet
come
to
the
fore
.
17 9
But
traditional
political
differences
based
on
disagreement
over
fundamental
values
play
a
diminishing
part
in
elections
.
37 11
For
example
,
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
,
the
next
major
leader
to
face
an
election
,
plays
the
personality
card
and
talks
about
policies
,
but
he
represents
above
all
a
set
of
middle-class
values
.
33 10
When
he
speaks
of
``
modernization
,
''
or
of
``
bringing
things
into
the
twenty-first
century
,
''
he
manages
to
suggest
a
strange
but
appealing
mixture
of
change
and
stability
.
11 7
This
has
left
the
Conservative
opposition
without
an
effective
response
.
28 12
Even
questions
like
tax
cuts
and
stricter
asylum
rules
do
not
quite
hit
the
value
chords
that
the
Republican
Party
in
the
US
has
managed
to
touch
.
18 12
The
picture
is
similar
in
Germany
,
where
the
overt
influence
of
value
politics
is
even
smaller
.
10 6
The
German
debate
is
still
largely
a
policy
debate
.
29 9
When
the
opposition
offers
the
government
talks
on
health-care
reform
or
,
most
recently
,
on
combating
unemployment
,
the
underlying
competition
is
about
competence
rather
than
values
.
22 10
Yet
underneath
the
common
battlegrounds
of
political
debate
in
Britain
and
Germany
and
elsewhere
in
Europe
,
value
clashes
are
lurking
.
32 17
Parties
fight
for
those
who
can
be
made
``
to
feel
good
about
themselves
,
''
but
they
may
not
fully
realize
that
this
is
only
partly
a
matter
of
policy
.
31 13
Religion
is
not
likely
to
become
a
major
factor
in
European
politics
;
opinion
polls
show
that
religious
observance
marks
one
of
the
few
major
differences
between
Americans
and
Europeans
.
22 9
Guns
also
have
a
different
place
in
the
European
mind
;
it
is
their
absence
that
most
Europeans
regard
as
important
.
11 7
A
pacifist
streak
of
values
is
also
unmistakable
in
Europe
.
21 8
But
the
issue
of
political
correctness
-LRB-
``
gays
''
-RRB-
plays
a
so-far
underrated
part
in
Europe
as
well
.
21 9
Most
importantly
,
the
Europe
itself
divides
Europeans
,
as
the
``
national
question
''
arises
in
each
European
state
.
11 10
It
is
an
issue
of
values
,
inspired
by
fear
.
29 11
People
want
to
know
where
they
belong
,
and
in
the
process
they
turn
against
the
US
and
toward
Europe
,
or
against
Europe
and
toward
their
country
.
25 9
Either
way
,
we
leave
the
realms
of
policies
,
and
even
of
politics
,
and
enter
the
murky
domain
of
symbols
and
myth
.
25 9
This
,
at
any
rate
,
is
the
main
risk
that
democratic
countries
face
,
for
the
politics
of
values
is
a
dangerous
development
.
18 14
It
reintroduces
fundamental
divisions
in
societies
whose
greatest
democratic
achievement
was
precisely
to
banish
fundamentalism
from
politics
.
16 13
Enlightened
public
debate
must
be
a
dispute
about
policies
contained
by
a
community
of
values
.
14 9
Insisting
on
this
is
therefore
a
primary
objective
of
the
politics
of
freedom
.
43 10
The
Coming
Age
of
Interest
One
swallow
does
not
make
a
summer
,
and
one
month
of
normal
job
growth
,
and
rising
prices
in
the
United
States
does
not
mean
that
the
Federal
Reserve
no
longer
fears
economic
malaise
and
deflation
.
25 17
But
the
time
will
come
when
world
interest
rates
begin
to
rise
,
as
central
bankers
prepare
to
resist
the
upward
creep
of
inflation
.
48 16
Whenever
that
moment
arrives
-
whether
this
fall
,
in
2005
or
2006
,
or
in
2007
-
America
and
the
global
economy
will
face
financial
vulnerabilities
that
reflect
the
success
of
the
past
three
years
of
monetary
stimulation
in
stemming
declines
in
production
and
moderating
unemployment
.
27 8
Short-term
interest
rates
are
astonishingly
low
:
only
2
%
in
the
euro
zone
,
just
1
%
in
the
US
,
and
zero
in
Japan
.
35 16
Expansionary
monetary
policy
has
been
successful
,
but
only
by
pushing
interest
rates
to
historic
lows
-
and
by
convincing
investors
that
borrowing
costs
will
remain
at
their
current
levels
for
a
long
time
.
52 12
The
main
result
of
monetary
stimulus
has
been
to
boost
asset
prices
:
anything
that
pays
a
yield
,
a
dividend
,
or
a
rent
becomes
much
more
attractive
-
and
hence
much
more
valuable
in
money
terms
-
when
interest
rates
are
very
low
and
expected
to
stay
very
low
.
41 13
This
explains
the
large
gaps
between
current
prices
for
real
estate
in
the
US
,
equities
in
New
York
,
London
,
and
Frankfurt
,
and
long-term
bonds
everywhere
and
what
one
would
conventionally
think
their
fundamental
values
should
be
.
12 12
So
what
will
happen
when
central
banks
start
raising
interest
rates
?
33 14
In
1994
,
rising
short-term
rates
caused
increases
in
long-term
rates
-
and
declines
in
long-term
bond
prices
-
that
were
at
least
double
what
standard
models
at
the
time
were
predicting
.
23 8
Moreover
,
interest
rates
in
the
world
's
peripheral
,
developing
economies
rose
far
more
than
rates
in
the
advanced
industrial
core
.
30 10
Thus
,
the
first
danger
to
worry
about
for
2005
and
beyond
-
when
world
interest
rates
will
most
likely
rise
-
is
another
wave
of
emerging-market
financial
crises
.
54 16
For
countries
like
Mexico
,
Brazil
,
Turkey
,
Argentina
,
Korea
,
Malaysia
,
and
Thailand
,
the
record
of
the
1990
's
demonstrates
that
interest-rate
spreads
can
widen
and
capital
flows
reverse
remarkably
rapidly
,
regardless
of
how
favorably
IMF
officials
and
analyses
by
major
banks
view
a
country
's
policies
.
8 5
Emerging-market
interest-rate
spreads
now
are
abnormally
low
.
39 17
International
money
flows
-
aside
from
inflows
into
the
US
-
are
not
yet
at
levels
associated
with
``
irrational
exuberance
,
''
but
there
is
still
time
for
that
to
happen
before
interest
rates
start
to
rise
.
30 14
This
is
an
alarming
prospect
,
because
if
there
is
one
lesson
from
the
1990
's
,
it
is
that
nobody
should
overestimate
the
stability
of
international
financial
flows
.
14 6
The
second
danger
springs
from
high
asset
values
within
the
advanced
industrial
core
.
50 17
The
dominant
mode
of
thought
within
the
Federal
Reserve
-
with
which
I
agree
-
appears
to
be
that
the
information-technology
revolution
is
continuing
,
that
the
pace
of
growth
of
potential
output
in
the
US
remains
very
fast
,
and
that
the
output
gap
is
thus
relatively
wide
.
20 14
This
implies
that
interest
rates
may
,
in
fact
,
need
to
stay
low
for
a
very
considerable
period
.
29 9
Moreover
,
confidence
in
the
Federal
Reserve
is
high
,
and
the
last
remnants
of
the
1970
's
inflation
risk
premium
have
been
wrung
out
of
interest
rates
.
30 10
As
a
result
,
even
after
output
levels
return
to
their
potential
,
interest
rates
will
stay
low
by
the
standards
of
the
1980
's
and
the
1990
's
.
25 13
All
of
this
is
,
of
course
,
good
news
for
those
who
own
assets
like
long-term
bonds
,
stocks
,
and
real
estate
.
33 16
Indeed
,
elevating
long-term
asset
prices
was
precisely
the
point
of
lowering
interest
rates
:
making
bondholders
and
especially
real
estate
owners
richer
,
after
all
,
provides
a
fillip
to
spending
.
27 15
But
the
bad
news
is
that
even
if
interest
rates
are
expected
to
remain
low
for
a
while
,
they
will
not
stay
this
low
indefinitely
.
15 9
The
bottom
line
is
that
when
interest
rates
rise
,
asset
values
will
fall
.
38 16
It
is
during
such
periods
-
particularly
when
asset
values
fall
swiftly
and
substantially
-
that
we
discover
exactly
how
good
our
central
bankers
are
at
their
main
job
:
reducing
financial
volatility
and
promoting
economic
stability
.
51 22
It
is
also
during
such
periods
that
we
discover
how
many
people
who
are
holding
long-term
bonds
,
real
estate
,
or
stocks
are
doing
so
not
because
they
think
current
prices
are
attractive
relative
to
fundamentals
,
but
because
their
prices
have
gone
up
over
the
past
several
years
.
39 20
This
is
a
crucial
question
for
policy
makers
,
because
those
who
bought
long-term
assets
due
to
what
seemed
like
perpetually
rising
prices
are
also
those
who
will
sell
as
soon
as
price
trends
seem
to
be
reversing
.
21 8
In
particular
,
the
US
trade
deficit
looms
as
a
massive
source
of
instability
should
long-term
asset
prices
fall
significantly
.
35 13
To
be
sure
,
the
challenges
facing
the
world
's
economic
policy
makers
during
the
next
several
years
will
be
different
from
those
that
they
have
faced
since
the
collapse
of
the
NASDAQ
bubble
.
21 13
The
risks
associated
with
inflation
are
probably
less
dangerous
than
those
generated
by
collapsing
output
and
the
threat
of
deflation
.
24 12
But
,
as
we
learned
in
the
1990
's
,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
coming
challenges
will
be
easier
to
handle
.
39 11
America
's
Opposing
Futures
I
recently
learned
something
interesting
:
American
international
finance
economists
and
American
domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
have
very
different
--
indeed
,
opposing
--
views
of
the
likely
consequences
of
America
's
huge
current-account
deficit
.
23 10
International
finance
economists
see
a
financial
crisis
as
likely
,
followed
by
a
painful
and
perhaps
prolonged
recession
in
the
United
States
.
30 11
Domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
,
by
contrast
,
see
a
forthcoming
fall
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
not
as
a
crisis
,
but
as
an
opportunity
to
accelerate
growth
.
41 15
Domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
look
at
the
situation
roughly
like
this
:
at
some
point
in
the
future
,
foreign
central
banks
will
become
less
willing
to
continue
buying
massive
amounts
of
dollar-denominated
securities
in
order
to
prop
up
the
greenback
.
22 7
When
they
cease
their
large-scale
dollar-purchase
programs
,
the
value
of
the
dollar
will
fall
--
and
it
will
fall
hard
.
37 11
But
,
according
to
this
view
,
as
the
dollar
's
value
declines
,
US
exports
will
become
more
attractive
to
foreigners
and
American
employment
will
rise
,
with
labor
re-allocated
to
the
newly-vibrant
export
sector
.
57 23
It
will
be
like
what
happened
in
Britain
after
it
abandoned
its
exchange-rate
peg
and
allowed
the
pound
to
depreciate
relative
to
the
Deutschmark
,
or
what
happened
in
the
US
in
the
late
1980
's
,
when
the
dollar
depreciated
against
the
pound
,
the
Deutschmark
,
and
--
most
importantly
--
the
Japanese
yen
.
9 6
International
finance
economists
see
a
far
bleaker
future
.
48 17
They
see
the
end
of
large-scale
dollar-purchase
programs
by
central
banks
leading
not
only
to
a
decline
in
the
dollar
,
but
also
to
a
spike
in
US
long-term
interest
rates
,
which
will
curb
consumption
spending
immediately
and
throttle
investment
spending
after
only
a
short
lag
.
46 14
To
be
sure
,
international
finance
economists
also
see
US
exports
benefiting
as
the
value
of
the
dollar
declines
,
but
the
lags
in
demand
are
such
that
the
export
boost
will
come
a
year
or
two
after
the
decline
in
consumption
and
investment
spending
.
27 14
Eight
to
ten
million
people
will
have
to
shift
employment
from
services
and
construction
into
exports
and
import-competing
goods
,
implying
that
structural
unemployment
will
rise
.
33 11
Moreover
,
there
may
be
a
financial
panic
:
large
financial
institutions
with
short-term
liabilities
and
long-term
assets
will
have
a
difficult
time
weathering
a
large
rise
in
long-term
dollar-denominated
interest
rates
.
43 14
This
mismatch
can
cause
financial
stress
and
bankruptcy
just
as
easily
as
banks
'
local-currency
assets
and
dollar
liabilities
caused
stress
and
bankruptcy
in
the
Mexican
and
East
Asian
crises
of
the
1990
's
and
in
the
Argentinean
crisis
of
this
decade
.
23 11
When
international
finance
economists
sketch
this
scenario
,
domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
respond
that
it
sounds
like
a
case
of
incompetent
monetary
policy
.
22 13
Why
should
the
Federal
Reserve
allow
long-term
interest
rates
to
spike
just
because
other
central
banks
have
ceased
their
dollar-purchase
programs
?
32 12
Should
not
the
Fed
step
in
and
replace
them
with
its
own
purchases
of
long-term
US
Treasury
bonds
,
thereby
keeping
long-term
interest
rates
at
a
level
conducive
to
full
employment
?
19 13
To
this
,
international
finance
economists
respond
that
the
Fed
does
not
have
the
power
to
do
so
.
42 15
When
forced
to
choose
between
full
employment
and
price
stability
,
the
international
finance
economists
say
that
the
Fed
will
choose
price
stability
,
because
its
institutional
memory
of
the
1970
's
,
when
inflation
ran
rampant
,
remains
very
strong
.
51 10
Therefore
,
since
a
fall
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
raises
import
prices
,
and
thus
functions
as
a
negative
shock
to
the
supply
side
of
the
economy
,
the
Fed
will
have
to
raise
,
not
lower
,
interest
rates
,
and
sell
,
not
buy
,
bonds
.
18 10
Serious
economists
whom
I
respect
enormously
find
themselves
taking
strong
positions
on
opposite
sides
of
this
debate
.
23 13
I
'm
not
wise
enough
to
say
which
side
is
right
,
but
I
certainly
know
which
side
I
hope
is
wrong
.
20 9
Europe
's
Free
Riders
In
the
United
States
,
individual
states
that
follow
unsound
fiscal
policies
face
a
penalty
.
14 11
Their
bonds
sell
at
a
discount
relative
to
those
of
better-managed
individual
states
.
28 14
The
higher
debt
service
they
must
pay
serves
--
to
some
degree
--
as
a
form
of
discipline
against
the
temptation
to
spend
now
and
pay
later
.
34 10
Of
course
,
the
discipline
of
the
market
is
not
perfect
:
the
bond
market
does
not
``
see
''
implicit
future
liabilities
-LRB-
like
promised
pension
payments
-RRB-
to
any
great
degree
.
35 12
Nevertheless
,
this
enforced
fiscal
discipline
,
combined
with
individual
states
'
own
internal
budgetary
procedures
,
has
prevented
a
large
scale
state-level
fiscal
crisis
from
occurring
in
the
US
since
the
Great
Depression
.
7 7
Let
us
now
turn
to
Europe
.
26 13
Before
the
advent
of
the
euro
,
there
were
many
fiscal
crises
in
individual
nation-states
in
southern
Europe
,
which
produced
waves
of
high
inflation
.
37 11
But
,
with
the
single
currency
in
place
,
the
road
to
solving
a
fiscal
crisis
through
inflation
has
been
closed
,
as
the
European
Central
Bank
-LRB-
ECB
-RRB-
now
stands
watch
over
monetary
policy
.
55 17
Nevertheless
,
even
with
nation-states
no
longer
able
to
rely
on
inflation
to
solve
their
unbalanced
finances
,
the
single
currency
allows
them
to
use
the
debt
capacity
properly
belonging
to
other
members
of
the
European
Union
to
extend
their
spending
sprees
and
postpone
political
accountability
for
periods
of
laissez
les
bons
temps
roulés
.
27 11
To
head
off
this
possibility
,
the
EU
created
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
:
government
deficits
had
to
be
less
than
3
%
of
GDP
.
41 9
Last
week
,
the
government
of
Germany
--
once
the
most
fiscally
prudent
and
disciplined
EU
country
--
broke
the
pact
's
rules
for
fiscal
discipline
for
the
fifth
consecutive
year
,
and
did
so
without
-LRB-
much
-RRB-
apology
.
37 13
Finance
Minister
Peer
Steinbrueck
signaled
that
he
expected
the
European
Commission
to
apply
some
sanctions
to
Germany
:
the
credibility
of
the
pact
would
,
he
said
,
be
at
stake
if
no
action
were
taken
.
20 11
Thus
,
Germany
would
not
block
sanctions
this
time
,
as
it
did
two
and
a
half
years
ago
.
41 19
But
Steinbrueck
also
made
it
clear
that
he
expects
any
sanctions
in
response
to
Germany
's
predicted
3.4
%
-
of-GDP
fiscal
deficit
to
be
largely
symbolic
,
not
penalties
that
would
cost
its
government
or
economy
anything
of
significance
.
24 15
The
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
is
not
--
or
is
not
yet
--
working
anywhere
near
the
way
it
was
intended
to
work
.
5 5
What
about
market
discipline
?
31 20
Is
the
German
government
's
willingness
to
issue
more
debt
and
run
bigger
deficits
limited
because
the
market
recognizes
and
penalizes
nation
states
that
allow
their
fiscal
positions
to
weaken
?
6 5
In
a
word
,
no
.
18 8
The
interest
rates
on
the
euro-denominated
sovereign
debt
of
the
twelve
euro-zone
governments
are
all
very
similar
.
34 23
So
the
market
does
not
seem
to
care
that
countries
have
different
potentials
to
generate
exports
to
fund
the
financial
flows
needed
for
debt
repayments
,
or
different
current
and
projected
debt-to-GDP
ratios
.
49 20
Willem
Buiter
of
the
University
of
Amsterdam
and
Anne
Sibert
of
the
University
of
London
believe
that
it
is
the
ECB
's
willingness
to
,
in
effect
,
accept
all
euro-zone
debt
as
collateral
that
has
undermined
the
market
's
willingness
to
be
an
enforcer
of
fiscal
prudence
.
54 17
As
long
as
the
marginal
piece
of
German
debt
is
used
as
collateral
for
a
short-term
loan
or
as
the
centerpiece
of
a
repurchase
agreement
to
gain
liquidity
,
its
value
is
much
more
likely
to
be
determined
by
the
terms
on
which
the
ECB
accepts
it
as
collateral
than
by
its
fundamentals
.
26 10
The
ECB
's
treatment
of
all
such
debt
as
equally
powerful
sources
of
back-up
liquidity
now
trumps
any
analysis
of
differences
in
long-term
sovereign
risk
.
9 5
In
the
long
run
,
this
is
dangerous
.
19 11
Both
market
discipline
and
sound
fiscal
management
are
needed
to
create
a
reasonable
chance
of
long-run
price
stability
.
47 18
Omit
either
a
market
penalty
now
for
behavior
that
may
become
reckless
or
the
institutional
levers
that
give
a
voice
to
future
generations
,
and
you
run
grave
risks
--
perhaps
not
today
or
tomorrow
,
but
someday
,
and
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
26 12
As
time
passes
,
the
coming
of
the
single
currency
and
the
way
that
the
euro
has
been
implemented
is
generating
more
and
more
unease
.
13 8
Policy
as
a
whole
over
the
entire
euro
zone
is
too
deflationary
.
29 19
The
necessary
transfers
are
not
being
made
to
make
the
common
currency
bearable
to
regions
that
lose
out
and
are
already
in
recession
when
the
ECB
tightens
policy
.
12 6
The
institutional
foundations
of
stable
long-run
fiscal
policy
are
being
eroded
.
29 13
And
now
,
Buiter
and
Sibert
argue
convincingly
,
the
ECB
is
giving
the
market
less
scope
to
reward
the
thrifty
and
penalize
the
profligate
than
it
should
.
18 8
There
is
no
movement
of
the
soil
yet
,
and
there
will
not
be
for
some
time
.
17 12
But
the
ground
under
the
euro
may
well
begin
to
shift
if
things
do
n't
change
.

Milosevic
and
Hussein
:
Trial
by
Farce
Trials
of
war
criminals
were
once
serious
business
.
17 13
Recall
the
photographs
of
Herman
Goering
and
Rudolf
Hess
sitting
glumly
in
the
dock
at
Nuremberg
.
13 9
Some
Nazi
leaders
were
even
hanged
after
relatively
short
but
fair
trials
.
15 7
Nowadays
,
legal
proceedings
against
the
world
's
most
wicked
leaders
have
become
farce
.
16 7
The
trial
of
Saddam
Hussein
and
his
Ba'athist
cronies
offers
an
ongoing
series
of
embarrassments
.
23 11
The
defendants
try
one
antic
after
another
,
and
Hussein
shows
every
form
of
contempt
possible
except
``
mooning
''
the
judge
.
20 18
It
is
hard
to
expect
an
outcome
that
will
appear
legitimate
in
the
eyes
of
Iraqis
or
the
world
.
27 10
Meanwhile
,
Slobodan
Milosevic
's
trial
morphed
into
a
funeral
after
four
boring
years
of
testimony
and
a
sunken
cost
of
more
than
$
200
million
.
26 15
In
Cambodia
,
the
United
Nations
and
the
government
have
dickered
for
almost
a
decade
about
how
to
bring
surviving
Khmer
Rouge
figures
to
trial
.
37 13
The
mass
killers
who
took
power
in
the
twentieth
century
were
doomed
to
being
killed
in
popular
revolts
or
to
being
tried
for
their
crimes
--
that
is
,
if
they
did
not
die
in
power
.
28 13
Who
can
be
proud
that
Romania
's
last
Communist
boss
,
Nicolai
Ceaucescu
,
and
his
wife
were
shot
without
even
the
semblance
of
a
fair
trial
?
23 8
The
formal
trappings
of
a
real
court
always
seem
better
than
instant
justice
,
even
if
the
end
result
is
also
death
.
13 11
Today
there
are
two
plausible
ways
to
proceed
against
a
deposed
tyrant
.
33 17
A
nation
could
put
its
own
former
leaders
on
trial
,
as
the
Argentines
did
in
the
1980
's
with
the
generals
responsible
for
the
disappearance
of
more
than
5,000
fellow
citizens
.
49 19
At
the
international
level
,
the
Nuremberg
model
remains
available
to
generate
further
trials
,
though
under
the
dubious
conditions
that
victorious
powers
sometimes
impose
liability
for
crimes
,
such
as
``
crimes
against
humanity
''
that
were
are
not
properly
defined
at
the
time
they
are
committed
.
17 12
There
was
a
time
when
we
could
see
the
advantages
of
both
national
and
international
trials
.
19 12
Home
grown
trials
enabled
the
local
community
to
work
out
its
grief
by
participating
closely
in
the
process
.
34 13
As
judges
and
juries
,
the
defendant
's
compatriots
could
also
bring
greater
sensitivity
to
the
assessment
of
guilt
because
they
appreciated
the
tough
conditions
under
which
a
deposed
dictator
made
his
decisions
.
28 12
Argentina
's
trial
of
the
generals
was
a
successful
ritual
in
the
painstaking
transition
from
military
junta
to
democracy
,
but
the
experience
ended
with
weeping
self-doubt
.
25 10
Even
after
conviction
,
the
generals
were
sufficiently
strong
to
exact
a
termination
of
the
trials
and
then
a
pardon
from
the
succeeding
president
.
17 12
Argentine
politics
is
still
embroiled
in
the
legal
consequences
of
those
trials
of
20
years
ago
.
31 12
At
the
international
level
,
the
UN
Security
Council
's
decision
to
establish
the
International
Criminal
Tribunal
for
the
Former
Yugoslavia
-LRB-
ICTY
-RRB-
was
also
greeted
with
great
confidence
.
14 9
The
ICTY
did
make
several
foundational
decisions
under
the
leadership
of
Antonio
Cassese
.
22 11
But
then
the
judges
had
the
misfortune
of
realizing
their
fondest
dream
--
trying
in
their
court
the
arch-villain
Slobodan
Milosevic
.
16 12
It
is
not
clear
how
the
Serbs
would
have
handled
Milosevic
in
a
local
trial
.
14 12
A
lot
would
have
depended
on
the
political
party
that
controlled
the
court
.
19 8
At
the
international
level
,
the
fear
was
not
of
too
much
politics
but
of
too
much
law
.
20 10
Milosevic
's
trial
had
to
be
more
than
fair
,
it
had
to
be
an
emblem
of
UN
Justice
.
21 14
Thus
Milosevic
was
allowed
to
defend
himself
--
a
huge
mistake
in
terms
of
the
trial
's
length
and
efficiency
.
25 19
There
was
no
limit
on
the
number
of
witnesses
the
prosecution
called
to
testify
about
the
same
gruesome
story
of
Serbian
aggression
and
brutality
.
20 13
It
will
take
many
months
to
determine
what
went
wrong
and
why
the
trial
lasted
a
scandalous
four
years
.
35 11
My
hunch
is
that
the
court
's
well-meaning
officials
were
too
influenced
by
the
South
African
Peace
and
Reconciliation
Commission
,
a
model
touted
in
law
schools
as
the
desired
alternative
to
retributive
justice
.
23 8
In
the
South
African
proceedings
the
most
important
question
was
not
the
future
of
the
defendant
but
the
past
of
the
victims
.
13 10
Every
victim
was
encouraged
to
tell
his
story
and
the
defendant
listened
.
17 10
In
the
case
of
massacres
endured
in
the
twentieth
century
,
such
storytelling
can
last
decades
.
31 11
Encouraging
victims
to
speak
and
then
giving
the
defendant
the
right
to
filibuster
the
proceedings
by
touting
his
merits
as
a
political
leader
amounts
to
a
formula
for
infinite
delay
.
31 13
One
lesson
we
have
learned
from
both
the
Milosevic
and
Hussein
trials
is
that
one
should
not
put
men
or
women
on
trial
in
order
to
terminate
their
charismatic
appeal
.
25 14
They
will
turn
the
trial
around
--
particularly
if
they
are
allowed
to
defend
themselves
--
and
use
the
courtroom
to
vindicate
their
careers
.
11 10
Tyrants
should
be
tried
only
after
they
are
clearly
defeated
.
22 12
Ironically
,
it
was
an
advantage
of
the
Nuremberg
courts
that
they
were
staffed
by
the
representatives
of
the
victorious
powers
.
27 11
They
were
a
constant
reminder
to
Goering
,
Hess
,
and
their
henchmen
that
the
Allies
were
in
charge
,
that
the
Nazis
were
irreversibly
defeated
.
23 8
Punishing
the
guilty
,
rather
than
shaping
the
way
history
would
be
written
,
was
always
the
clear
objective
of
the
trial
.
29 13
The
tragedy
of
the
Milosevic
and
Hussein
trials
is
that
the
``
i
``
s
of
history
were
not
yet
fully
dotted
and
history
itself
was
on
trial
.
25 12
The
resulting
hesitancy
of
those
in
charge
gave
rise
to
procedures
--
both
international
and
national
--
that
facilitated
fantasies
of
vindication
and
return
.
13 7
In
the
case
of
Hussein
,
that
fantasy
may
yet
become
real
.
22 9
Iraq
's
Economic
Divide
Everyone
who
looks
at
Iraq
sees
a
nation
divided
between
Shia
,
Sunni
,
and
Kurd
communities
.
38 14
But
an
equally
fundamental
division
--
one
that
has
contributed
as
much
to
the
ongoing
insurrection
as
sectarian
strife
and
opposition
to
the
American-led
military
occupation
--
is
the
widening
gap
between
Iraq
's
rich
and
poor
.
31 17
When
Iraq
was
liberated
,
most
people
,
especially
the
poor
,
began
to
hope
for
a
charismatic
leader
who
would
save
them
from
the
bitter
reality
of
daily
life
.
30 11
Raised
in
fear
,
they
had
no
idea
how
democracy
could
apply
to
their
society
,
or
how
human-rights
groups
and
other
civic
organizations
could
help
shape
the
future
.
12 7
Soon
enough
,
Iraq
was
faced
with
a
new
social
divide
.
22 15
On
one
side
stood
people
who
understood
how
to
operate
in
a
democracy
,
attain
power
,
and
realize
their
ambitions
.
27 11
They
learned
to
speak
the
language
of
democracy
,
gaining
money
and
influence
in
the
process
and
enlisting
independent
organizations
to
defend
their
rights
and
privileges
.
33 12
On
the
other
side
,
however
,
remains
the
vast
population
of
powerless
Iraqis
,
including
widows
and
divorced
or
abandoned
women
with
no
one
to
provide
for
them
and
their
children
.
11 5
For
these
people
,
democracy
and
human
rights
mean
nothing
.
9 6
They
are
ignorant
,
poor
,
and
sick
.
28 14
Victimized
by
an
educational
system
that
collapsed
over
a
decade
ago
,
they
have
few
skills
that
can
help
them
find
employment
in
Iraq
's
blighted
economy
.
17 11
During
Saddam
's
reign
,
no
effort
was
made
to
raise
living
standards
for
the
poor
.
37 11
I
have
visited
the
huge
slums
of
Iraq
and
found
families
living
in
homes
with
barely
a
roof
to
cover
them
,
with
infestations
of
insects
everywhere
,
and
with
raw
sewage
seeping
under
their
doors
.
9 6
Day
or
night
,
they
live
in
darkness
.
30 9
Needing
nothing
more
than
food
,
decent
housing
,
and
the
possibility
of
a
job
,
these
families
wait
for
death
,
dreading
the
cries
of
their
starving
children
.
25 12
When
I
met
the
women
who
live
in
those
houses
,
they
showered
me
with
questions
:
will
democracy
give
us
food
and
houses
?
9 8
Will
democracy
stop
men
from
beating
their
wives
?
8 6
Will
it
give
citizenship
to
our
children
?
14 13
Will
it
give
us
the
right
to
divorce
the
husbands
who
abandon
us
?
12 8
My
answer
to
all
of
these
questions
was
``
yes
.
''
38 12
Yes
,
democracy
will
give
you
the
right
to
live
in
a
decent
house
,
the
right
to
learn
and
work
,
and
it
will
give
citizenship
to
your
children
and
make
you
equal
with
your
men
.
16 12
But
you
have
to
work
hard
and
make
every
possible
effort
in
demanding
your
rights
.
20 12
They
replied
:
``
Saddam
taught
us
for
35
years
how
to
be
jobless
,
silent
,
and
fearful
.
7 6
What
can
we
do
now
?
''
17 7
In
these
destitute
areas
,
where
most
Iraqis
live
,
people
are
prey
to
bitter
temptations
.
11 9
Many
are
beyond
the
reach
of
political
or
government
leaders
.
11 7
They
fall
easily
into
violence
,
theft
,
and
sabotage
.
35 20
Poverty
drives
some
to
take
money
in
exchange
for
acts
of
violence
,
abetted
by
the
lure
of
a
false
heroism
that
they
were
not
able
to
act
upon
during
Saddam
's
long
reign
.
22 14
Poverty
has
exacerbated
the
trauma
of
Iraq
's
violent
history
of
wars
and
atrocities
,
which
has
desensitized
people
to
killing
.
30 15
Though
conditions
in
Iraq
today
are
drawing
many
young
men
toward
violence
,
I
am
convinced
that
we
need
only
to
provide
decent
jobs
and
housing
to
save
them
.
17 10
Jobs
,
in
particular
,
will
help
young
people
to
create
new
lives
through
serious
work
.
13 11
We
must
not
use
no-work
jobs
to
disguise
an
army
of
unemployed
.
17 16
We
must
give
people
jobs
that
allow
them
to
make
a
contribution
to
rebuilding
the
country
.
19 12
By
nature
,
every
individual
seeks
to
prove
himself
as
a
useful
person
in
his
or
her
society
.
24 12
But
the
culture
that
Saddam
created
convinced
Iraqis
that
political
connections
are
the
only
way
to
gain
authority
,
money
,
and
knowledge
.
39 25
Overcoming
such
sentiments
will
take
time
and
a
vibrant
economy
,
which
means
that
a
new
Iraqi
government
must
have
limited
power
,
allowing
the
private
sector
to
grow
while
encouraging
widespread
understanding
of
democracy
and
human
rights
.
10 10
Religious
groups
are
ready
to
contribute
to
this
process
.
25 17
We
can
also
rehabilitate
the
technocrats
who
served
under
Saddam
,
so
that
they
,
too
,
have
a
chance
to
serve
their
country
.
20 11
Last
but
not
least
,
we
must
provide
loans
to
poor
families
to
help
them
build
a
respectable
life
.
36 18
Above
all
,
the
government
must
spare
no
effort
in
convincing
poor
Iraqis
of
the
value
of
democracy
and
freedom
,
and
how
important
the
constitution
is
in
realizing
their
aspirations
for
a
better
life
.
22 14
This
will
not
be
easy
to
achieve
in
a
country
where
many
people
consider
breaking
the
law
an
act
of
heroism
.
28 14
But
we
Iraqis
have
also
learned
that
power
should
not
be
concentrated
in
a
few
hands
,
and
that
establishing
justice
requires
fighting
all
forms
of
corruption
.
28 14
If
the
constitution
is
to
operate
as
the
guarantee
of
democracy
,
freedom
,
and
security
,
poor
Iraqis
must
learn
to
make
that
fight
their
own
.
20 7
The
Islamist
Identity
Everywhere
you
look
nowadays
,
Islam
is
used
-LRB-
and
misused
-RRB-
as
a
political
force
.
30 9
Some
Muslims
employ
it
as
a
call
to
action
;
many
in
the
West
-LRB-
and
elsewhere
-RRB-
perceive
it
as
an
``
other
''
demanding
containment
and
exclusion
.
13 7
As
a
Turk
,
I
feel
both
sides
of
this
debate
directly
.
28 14
The
reason
that
Islam
seems
like
a
religion
of
the
``
other
''
to
Western
eyes
is
that
the
West
has
witnessed
a
systematic
de-institutionalization
of
religion
.
27 12
It
is
not
religion
that
disappeared
from
modern
Western
life
,
of
course
,
but
rather
the
claims
that
religious
institutions
can
make
on
individual
behavior
.
17 7
Religion
in
the
modern
world
is
a
much
more
personal
and
spiritual
experience
than
ever
before
.
15 8
Yet
a
process
of
de-institutionalization
of
religious
experience
is
also
taking
place
within
Islam
.
16 10
Politicization
of
Islam
is
displacing
the
authority
of
Islam
's
religious
classes
,
the
ulema
.
13 6
As
in
the
West
,
Islamic
religious
experience
is
becoming
more
personal
.
20 8
Interpretation
of
religious
texts
by
individual
Muslims
,
including
political
militants
,
intellectuals
and
women
,
is
one
result
.
24 12
Another
is
the
vulgarization
of
religious
knowledge
,
with
the
Koran
's
teachings
abused
and
taken
out
of
context
to
support
political
ends
.
13 12
Who
now
decides
what
is
legitimate
and
what
is
illicit
in
Islam
?
9 10
Who
has
the
authority
to
interpret
religious
texts
?
13 7
Who
can
issue
a
``
fatwa
''
or
declare
``
jihad
''
?
17 9
Nowadays
,
activism
and
terrorism
provide
,
or
rather
impose
,
a
new
source
of
legitimacy
.
22 12
So
lay
people
decide
what
Islam
does
and
does
not
mean
,
without
the
authority
of
religious
schools
and
specialized
training
.
18 8
Indeed
,
Islam
today
is
primarily
interpreted
through
political
actors
and
cultural
movements
,
not
religious
institutions
.
31 18
This
de-institutionalization
has
enabled
Islam
to
move
from
being
a
local
and
national
social
bond
to
forging
imaginary
ties
between
all
Muslims
,
everywhere
,
who
feel
oppressed
or
displaced
.
31 11
Thus
,
Islamism
can
unite
adherents
who
previously
were
deeply
divided
:
spiritual
Sufi
and
canonized
Shariat
Muslims
;
Shia
and
Sunni
Muslims
;
conservative
Saudi
Arabia
and
revolutionary
Iran
.
27 11
At
the
same
time
,
Islam
is
on
the
move
,
with
its
believers
leaving
rural
areas
for
cities
,
including
the
cities
of
the
West
.
30 12
Many
see
this
movement
as
something
negative
,
emphasizing
the
fact
that
these
people
are
socially
uprooted
,
which
leads
to
alienation
and
,
for
some
,
to
terrorism
.
13 9
But
social
mobility
is
also
a
precondition
for
creating
a
modern
outlook
.
23 9
Of
course
,
through
migration
Muslims
experience
a
sense
of
distancing
,
if
not
an
outright
break
,
from
their
social
origins
.
20 7
So
their
religious
experience
is
of
a
new
kind
,
bereft
of
theological
,
community
,
or
state
institutions
.
25 14
Religious
experience
instead
becomes
a
form
of
social
imagination
within
which
they
reconstruct
a
sense
of
belonging
to
Islam
in
new
and
strange
surroundings
.
20 9
It
is
not
distance
from
modern
life
,
but
proximity
to
it
that
triggers
a
return
to
religious
identity
.
30 15
Indeed
,
most
radicalism
arises
in
groups
who
,
by
their
experience
of
mobility
and
displacement
,
are
acquainted
with
secular
Western
ways
of
political
thinking
and
urban
living
.
10 7
Disoriented
by
unfamiliar
surroundings
,
Islam
becomes
their
anchor
.
26 12
But
for
this
anchor
to
work
,
Islam
must
be
liberated
from
its
traditionally
subservient
,
passive
and
docile
posture
in
the
face
of
modernity
.
31 12
By
wearing
a
veil
or
beard
,
claiming
the
right
for
places
to
pray
at
work
or
school
,
and
demanding
special
foods
,
Muslims
identify
themselves
overtly
as
Muslims
.
27 17
They
are
telling
everyone
around
them
that
they
are
more
zealous
and
meticulous
in
their
religious
observance
than
those
who
confine
their
religiosity
to
private
life
.
19 12
For
example
,
non-Muslims
usually
see
veiling
as
a
sign
of
the
debasement
and
inferiority
of
Muslim
women
.
22 13
From
a
stigma
,
however
,
it
has
become
for
Muslims
a
sign
of
their
positive
affirmation
of
an
Islamic
identity
.
10 6
Young
Muslim
women
in
Europe
illustrate
this
transformation
perfectly
.
37 11
Girls
who
adopt
the
headscarf
in
French
and
German
schools
are
closer
in
many
respects
-LRB-
namely
youth
culture
,
fashion
consciousness
,
and
language
-RRB-
to
their
classmates
than
to
their
homebound
,
uneducated
mothers
.
24 11
In
adopting
the
headscarf
for
Europe
's
public
sphere
,
these
girls
are
unintentionally
altering
the
symbol
and
the
role
of
Muslim
women
.
7 6
This
tendency
extends
deeper
than
headscarves
.
15 8
All
Western
Muslims
possess
a
double
sense
of
belonging
,
a
double
cultural
capital
.
17 7
They
define
themselves
through
their
religiosity
,
but
they
also
have
gained
universal
,
secular
knowledge
.
31 8
Because
they
have
a
double
cultural
capital
,
they
can
circulate
relatively
freely
between
different
activities
and
spaces
--
home
,
school
,
youth
associations
,
and
urban
leisure
space
.
13 7
Being
a
Muslim
and
being
an
Islamist
are
not
the
same
thing
.
17 9
What
we
are
witnessing
today
is
a
shift
from
a
Muslim
identity
to
an
Islamist
identity
.
17 8
The
religious
self
for
individual
Muslims
is
being
shifted
from
the
private
to
the
public
realm
.
38 15
The
question
for
everyone
is
whether
that
search
for
identity
can
be
satisfied
with
headscarves
and
wide
public
acceptance
of
Islamic
religious
practice
,
or
if
positive
affirmation
of
Islam
demands
a
more
fundamental
renunciation
of
modernity
.
7 5
A
New
Era
for
Islamic
Science
?
26 10
For
a
few
hundred
years
,
when
science
and
mathematics
were
enjoying
a
period
of
great
invention
,
one
region
of
the
world
stood
out
.
23 10
Masters
of
these
disciplines
were
revered
there
,
medicine
advanced
quickly
,
and
the
average
person
was
curious
about
how
nature
worked
.
9 5
Not
surprisingly
,
this
region
was
globally
respected
.
16 7
In
the
other
half
of
the
known
planet
,
scientists
were
punished
,
even
killed
.
16 10
Mathematics
was
outlawed
as
irreligious
and
alien
,
and
was
later
made
subservient
to
religion
.
7 6
The
standard
of
living
was
low
.
16 8
The
prosperous
region
was
the
Islamic
Middle
East
,
while
an
ignorant
Europe
remained
poor
.
30 15
Both
regions
were
religiously
governed
-LRB-
historians
differ
about
the
role
and
natures
of
the
religions
in
this
context
-RRB-
,
but
science
flourished
only
in
one
of
them
.
17 7
Now
,
of
course
the
roles
of
the
Islamic
Middle
East
and
the
West
are
reversed
.
18 8
Since
World
War
II
,
the
United
States
has
been
the
world
's
undisputed
leader
in
science
.
23 10
Throughout
this
period
,
the
brightest
students
were
drawn
away
from
their
native
lands
,
attracted
by
superior
research
universities
and
opportunities
.
22 9
Until
recently
,
more
than
half
of
all
mathematics
,
science
,
and
engineering
graduate
students
in
the
US
were
foreign-born
.
18 8
Many
of
these
talents
stayed
after
graduation
,
and
both
industry
and
government
took
advantage
of
this
.
19 12
Meanwhile
,
Islamic
cultures
entered
a
historical
phase
in
which
science
was
equated
with
Western
influence
and
eschewed
.
38 16
Even
in
countries
where
oil
revenues
could
fuel
a
significant
amount
of
research
,
Arab
rulers
did
not
encourage
such
investment
,
with
the
result
that
their
societies
have
not
prospered
as
much
as
they
might
have
.
28 16
Recently
,
a
desire
for
greater
political
respect
has
spurred
Islamic
nations
to
invest
in
technology
,
which
is
most
visible
in
Pakistani
and
Iranian
nuclear
ambitions
.
17 7
But
while
such
weapons
carry
political
weight
,
the
science
behind
them
is
mundane
and
old
.
19 14
More
meaningful
is
the
respect
that
comes
from
incubating
insights
,
rather
than
the
products
of
past
discoveries
.
20 18
Imagine
the
influence
that
would
be
generated
by
a
Pakistani
institute
that
was
the
world
leader
in
cancer
research
.
16 11
Would
the
political
rhetoric
shift
if
researchers
in
Oman
discovered
a
key
to
suppressing
AIDS
?
6 7
This
is
one
unclaimed
opportunity
.
11 7
But
another
exists
,
and
not
just
for
Islamic
societies
.
8 6
The
US
has
made
profound
missteps
recently
.
18 9
``
Matters
of
faith
''
have
been
substituted
for
science
across
government
,
from
the
president
down
.
17 9
Top
researchers
have
had
their
reports
changed
by
political
operatives
when
the
facts
contradicted
official
belief
.
20 7
Encouraged
by
a
religiously
influenced
administration
,
school
systems
are
shifting
their
focus
from
science
to
``
values
.
''
28 14
Since
the
terrorist
attacks
of
September
2001
,
entry
visas
are
fewer
and
more
difficult
to
obtain
,
stanching
the
flow
of
young
talent
into
US
universities
.
9 7
Major
scientific
organizations
have
protested
,
without
result
.
25 16
At
the
same
time
,
tax
laws
have
been
revised
to
make
investors
wealthier
in
the
near
term
,
discouraging
long-term
investment
in
research
.
29 11
Half
a
trillion
dollars
was
committed
to
the
war
in
Iraq
,
an
amount
roughly
equal
to
the
sponsorship
of
all
basic
research
for
the
last
thousand
years
.
19 7
Even
if
the
US
avoids
a
fundamentalist
dark
age
,
it
clearly
risks
losing
its
global
research
dominance
.
14 7
Japan
recognized
the
link
between
political
clout
and
science
in
the
1980
's
.
42 13
Japan
's
chief
industrialist
,
Akio
Morita
,
the
chairman
of
Sony
,
and
the
right-wing
politician
Shintaro
Ishihara
gave
a
series
of
speeches
that
were
collected
and
published
in
1986
as
a
book
called
The
Japan
that
Can
Say
No
.
17 14
They
outlined
a
national
strategy
in
which
world
influence
was
understood
to
flow
from
scientific
leadership
.
26 15
The
key
idea
was
that
military
power
could
be
made
obsolete
if
the
``
food
chain
''
of
military
technologies
was
controlled
by
other
nations
.
25 9
The
book
's
title
refers
to
Japan
's
plan
to
``
say
no
''
to
US
military
influence
once
Japan
controlled
key
military
technologies
.
11 8
Building
a
knowledge-based
economy
using
oil
wealth
is
clearly
possible
.
18 6
For
example
,
Texas
,
like
most
southern
US
states
,
was
once
economically
poor
and
declining
.
28 10
Although
it
had
oil
revenue
,
the
flow
of
dollars
into
an
economy
,
by
itself
,
does
not
boost
prosperity
as
much
as
one
might
think
.
13 9
So
Texas
decided
to
devote
its
oil
money
to
an
educational
endowment
.
18 10
Today
,
that
endowment
is
roughly
equal
to
that
of
Harvard
University
and
spread
over
15
universities
.
20 9
The
effect
has
been
staggering
:
aerospace
manufacturing
has
almost
disappeared
from
California
,
but
is
booming
in
Texas
.
18 8
Telecom
research
centers
and
consortia
have
flocked
to
Texas
,
even
from
the
Canadian
telecommunications
giant
Nortel
.
21 9
Although
manufacturing
in
the
US
is
in
crisis
,
Texas
has
one
of
the
strongest
manufacturing
economies
in
the
world
.
17 11
There
is
no
reason
that
the
same
outcome
could
not
be
achieved
in
the
Middle
East
.
15 6
First
,
however
,
the
Islamic
world
must
rediscover
and
embrace
its
proud
heritage
.
22 8
Iran
's
Debate
Over
Iraq
No
country
in
the
Middle
East
is
monitoring
postwar
events
in
Iraq
more
closely
than
Iran
.
47 11
Geographical
proximity
,
an
intense
and
bloody
history
of
conflict
with
Saddam
Hussein
's
Iraq
,
religious
and
emotional
connections
to
Shi'a
Iraq
,
and
concerns
about
the
United
States
and
its
policies
in
the
region
are
all
threads
that
tie
Iran
to
its
western
neighbor
.
36 11
Given
ongoing
tensions
with
America
,
Iran
is
particularly
concerned
with
the
likelihood
of
a
continuing
US
presence
next
door
,
as
well
as
with
America
's
dominant
role
in
shaping
Iraq
's
post-Saddam
future
.
34 12
Outsiders
may
find
it
difficult
to
follow
internal
Iranian
debates
,
but
they
do
exist
,
and
they
are
intense
,
even
if
they
are
not
always
visible
to
the
wider
international
public
.
14 9
Three
general
approaches
are
recognizable
in
the
evolving
Iranian
debate
on
post-Saddam
Iraq
.
27 16
Iranian
pragmatists
argue
that
Iran
must
inevitably
cooperate
with
the
US
in
post-Saddam
Iraq
,
if
only
to
ensure
the
rights
of
Iraq
's
Shi'a
population
.
28 13
For
this
reason
,
Iran
should
win
assurances
that
a
new
leadership
in
Iraq
will
not
be
hostile
to
it
,
and
will
seek
friendly
bilateral
relations
.
25 14
Other
vital
considerations
for
the
pragmatists
include
preserving
Iraq
's
territorial
integrity
and
repatriation
of
tens
of
thousands
of
Iraqi
refugees
living
in
Iran
.
31 18
These
moderates
think
that
Iran
's
government
should
press
America
for
extradition
of
Iraq-based
members
of
the
Mujahdin-e
Khalq
Organization
-LRB-
MKO
-RRB-
,
as
well
as
its
total
dismantling
.
21 10
In
exchange
,
Iran
's
government
should
give
its
support
to
ensuring
peace
,
stability
,
and
security
in
Iraq
.
24 16
In
sum
,
the
pragmatists
would
limit
Iranian-American
dealings
,
keeping
them
focused
on
an
agenda
that
largely
reflects
Iran
's
domestic
concerns
.
12 6
By
and
large
,
conservative
forces
in
Iran
support
this
approach
.
14 8
Another
approach
envisions
a
more
active
,
cooperative
Iranian
role
in
reconstructing
Iraq
.
28 18
Advocates
of
this
view
argue
that
Iran
is
well
positioned
to
make
rebuilding
easier
,
owing
to
its
well-established
infrastructure
of
personal
and
institutional
ties
in
Iraq
.
20 8
Eventually
,
it
is
argued
,
the
US
and
the
international
community
will
recognize
the
value
of
Iranian
cooperation
.
39 15
Iranian
cooperation
should
be
repaid
with
the
dismantling
of
the
MKO
infrastructure
in
Iraq
,
perhaps
linked
to
an
Iranian
commitment
to
crack
down
further
on
any
al-Qaida
activities
,
as
well
as
expel
al-Qaida
members
from
Iran
.
36 21
Most
importantly
,
Iran
ought
to
press
for
an
American
assurance
that
its
cooperation
will
be
reciprocated
by
an
American
guarantee
that
Iran
will
not
be
a
target
of
American
military
action
in
the
future
.
57 21
In
short
,
advocates
of
cooperation
call
for
an
open
and
explicit
bargain
:
Iran
's
support
for
stability
during
the
current
transitional
phase
in
Iraq
,
as
well
as
its
commitment
to
maintain
cooperative
relations
with
whatever
permanent
government
emerges
in
Iraq
,
in
exchange
for
an
improvement
in
Iran
's
regional
and
international
position
.
26 12
This
view
is
widely
held
among
Iran
's
reformers
--
both
inside
and
outside
government
--
and
the
more
internationally
minded
technocratic
and
business
class
.
19 8
Finally
,
for
Iran
's
radicals
,
the
possibility
of
cooperative
relations
with
the
US
is
pure
fantasy
.
17 14
They
believe
that
America
is
bent
on
undermining
Iran
's
security
and
compromising
its
national
interests
.
23 10
In
the
radicals
'
view
,
the
US
will
at
the
very
least
seek
to
dictate
major
changes
in
Iranian
foreign
policy
.
16 9
At
most
,
they
argue
,
America
will
actively
push
for
regime
change
in
Iran
.
26 11
It
will
actively
work
against
Iran
's
acquisition
of
nuclear
knowledge
and
energy
,
and
may
yet
attempt
to
weaken
Iran
's
military
capability
altogether
.
17 12
These
radicals
view
the
US
invasion
of
Iraq
as
reflecting
America
's
desire
to
encircle
Iran
.
44 21
In
response
,
they
believe
that
Iran
must
be
aggressive
in
defending
its
interests
,
forming
strategic
alliances
with
Russia
and
other
regional
powers
,
and
using
Iran
's
influence
in
Iraq
to
prevent
a
pro-American
,
anti-Iran
government
from
emerging
in
Baghdad
.
8 6
Hardliners
of
all
factions
support
this
approach
.
13 7
Overthrowing
Saddam
's
regime
was
the
easy
part
of
the
Iraqi
crisis
.
45 17
Now
comes
the
hard
part
:
establishing
peace
and
security
,
winning
the
war
on
terrorism
,
and
convincing
the
Muslim
masses
that
America
is
not
intent
on
occupying
Iraq
,
siphoning
off
its
oil
,
and
reshaping
the
Middle
East
in
its
image
.
24 10
In
the
meantime
,
opposition
to
the
US
,
expressed
as
suicide
bombing
and
other
forms
of
terrorism
,
will
very
likely
increase
.
23 13
Iran
is
destined
to
remain
a
major
regional
player
because
its
political
dynamism
and
Muslim
identity
resonate
widely
in
the
Muslim
world
.
24 14
What
happens
in
Iraq
has
major
implications
for
Iran
,
and
the
US
is
well
advised
to
find
ways
of
recognizing
this
fact
.
25 8
American
threats
,
or
talk
of
another
war
,
fuel
the
fires
of
resentment
and
frustration
in
Iran
,
strengthening
the
most
radical
forces
.
36 16
If
the
US
wishes
to
avoid
this
outcome
,
it
must
consider
limiting
the
influence
of
its
own
radicals
,
recognizing
that
America
's
interests
in
Iraq
are
best
served
by
greater
cooperation
with
Iran
.
31 13
The
Way
Out
of
Iraq
At
last
the
point
has
been
reached
in
Iraq
where
everyone
ostensibly
wants
the
same
thing
:
the
departure
of
Coalition
forces
from
the
country
.
20 12
The
recent
leak
from
Britain
's
Ministry
of
Defense
of
a
discussion
paper
on
troop
withdrawal
highlights
this
desire
.
9 9
The
only
question
is
how
to
satisfy
it
.
14 8
As
long
as
the
Coalition
forces
stay
,
violence
is
likely
to
escalate
.
13 6
But
if
they
leave
,
it
will
also
escalate
,
only
faster
.
31 22
So
the
real
question
is
how
to
get
to
the
point
where
Iraq
has
a
police
force
and
army
that
can
be
trusted
to
maintain
law
as
well
as
order
.
10 10
Much
ground
must
be
covered
to
get
anywhere
close
.
31 14
Notwithstanding
the
courage
of
the
many
Iraqis
who
join
either
the
army
or
the
police
,
no
one
should
be
surprised
if
some
have
motives
that
are
less
than
pure
.
29 15
In
northern
Iraq
,
old
scores
are
being
settled
and
de
facto
ethnic
segregation
is
being
introduced
in
areas
,
such
as
Irbil
,
that
were
traditionally
diverse
.
12 8
In
other
areas
,
sharia
law
is
being
introduced
by
force
.
28 20
So
how
can
Iraq
create
uniformed
services
that
can
be
trusted
to
enforce
the
law
effectively
and
impartially
,
without
consideration
of
ethnicity
,
religion
and
gender
?
17 11
The
traditional
answer
is
to
recruit
,
train
,
and
instill
the
``
right
values
.
''
9 7
But
there
is
not
enough
time
for
that
.
5 5
Other
ways
are
needed
.
25 11
In
the
absence
of
a
deeply
instilled
value
system
,
Iraq
needs
grassroots
civil
society
organizations
that
will
hold
police
and
army
to
account
.
40 13
These
could
take
different
forms
,
but
what
is
important
is
that
they
are
truly
inclusive
at
a
local
level
,
and
that
they
get
support
from
district
,
regional
,
and
national
power
structures
when
they
highlight
abuses
.
45 12
If
there
is
local
scrutiny
,
and
national
reinforcement
and
recognition
of
the
value
of
that
scrutiny
,
then
most
members
of
the
uniformed
forces
are
likely
to
behave
appropriately
--
and
can
be
more
easily
identified
and
dealt
with
if
they
do
n't
.
27 12
This
might
appear
excessively
hopeful
,
yet
in
Afghanistan
,
a
country
akin
to
Iraq
in
many
ways
,
there
are
groups
working
towards
this
goal
.
19 11
The
Cooperation
for
Peace
and
Unity
-LRB-
CPAU
-RRB-
provides
a
model
of
how
this
can
be
done
.
21 11
In
Afghanistan
,
as
in
Iraq
,
ordinary
people
's
highest
priority
has
been
to
achieve
a
reduction
in
violence
.
26 9
CPAU
worked
across
the
country
in
the
last
three
years
to
set
up
District
level
Peace
Committees
,
supported
by
satellite
Peace
Councils
in
villages
.
25 16
The
initiative
faces
a
culture
in
which
violence
is
so
deeply
embedded
that
children
once
learned
arithmetic
by
counting
numbers
of
dead
Soviet
soldiers
.
41 14
The
Committees
therefore
seek
to
bring
together
all
sections
of
the
community
--
including
teachers
,
tribal
leaders
,
religious
leaders
,
women
,
police
,
soldiers
,
judges
,
and
businesspeople
--
to
develop
ways
of
resolving
conflicts
non-violently
.
61 13
Although
monitoring
has
not
been
a
formal
part
of
the
role
of
the
committees
until
now
-LRB-
it
is
planned
for
the
future
-RRB-
,
the
mere
fact
that
the
police
,
army
,
and
judiciary
are
part
of
these
committees
brings
them
into
contact
with
the
rest
of
the
community
,
provides
feedback
,
and
starts
to
build
trust
.
5 5
Some
results
are
remarkable
.
28 9
In
one
workshop
,
the
local
military
commander
came
for
a
couple
of
hours
,
as
a
courtesy
,
and
ended
up
staying
for
the
whole
week
.
21 9
At
the
end
,
he
apologized
for
his
violent
past
and
made
a
commitment
to
disarm
his
2,000-strong
private
army
.
8 5
He
now
visits
the
Committee
offices
regularly
.
39 20
In
Iraq
,
projects
such
as
the
Humanitarian
Liaison
Center
in
Kirkuk
are
starting
to
fulfill
a
monitoring
function
by
offering
the
ethnically
diverse
local
population
the
opportunity
to
bring
grievances
and
get
help
in
having
them
resolved
.
23 9
But
,
too
often
,
even
if
a
court
ruling
is
made
,
it
is
not
enforced
as
a
result
of
intimidation
.
17 8
Much
good
work
on
strengthening
civil
society
has
already
been
done
by
American
and
British
forces
.
24 12
We
do
n't
hear
about
the
workshops
for
women
's
empowerment
,
or
the
successful
organization
of
small-scale
local
elections
across
the
country
.
27 14
But
mobilizing
civil
society
is
hugely
challenging
,
particularly
when
,
as
in
Iraq
,
it
needs
to
be
done
quickly
and
on
a
large
scale
.
28 12
Military
force
is
still
necessary
,
but
so
are
incentives
to
disarm
,
including
the
prospect
of
economic
opportunities
that
are
more
fruitful
than
crime
and
extortion
.
16 8
Fortunately
,
building
the
capacity
of
civil
society
is
as
cheap
as
it
is
important
.
20 10
The
Humanitarian
Liaison
Center
serves
the
whole
of
Kirkuk
at
an
annual
cost
of
just
$
75,000
a
year
.
20 11
With
$
10
million
,
such
centers
could
be
replicated
100
times
--
with
plenty
of
change
left
over
.
32 18
The
challenge
is
to
commit
to
this
approach
,
to
scale
up
and
to
support
to
the
hilt
the
brave
people
who
take
on
the
challenge
of
holding
power
to
account
.
25 15
Otherwise
,
the
Iraqi
people
are
unlikely
to
get
the
security
that
,
after
so
many
years
of
suffering
,
they
so
desperately
need
.

Democracy
on
the
Nile
?
35 14
The
surprise
decision
by
Egyptian
President
Hosni
Mubarak
to
propose
a
constitutional
amendment
that
would
allow
direct
and
competitive
presidential
elections
may
be
a
giant
step
for
democracy
in
Egypt
and
the
Arab
World
.
31 19
Westerners
used
to
pluralistic
democracy
may
find
it
hard
to
understand
what
a
potentially
huge
shift
this
will
be
in
a
country
accustomed
to
military
rule
for
over
50
years
.
37 13
Under
the
current
system
,
Egyptian
citizens
can
only
show
up
on
the
day
of
a
presidential
referendum
every
six
years
and
say
yes
or
no
to
the
single
name
that
appears
on
the
presidential
ballot
.
20 11
This
explains
why
someone
like
Mubarak
always
received
over
90
%
of
the
vote
,
albeit
amid
indifferent
turnout
.
33 17
Syrian
and
Iraqi
strongmen
have
done
even
better
with
this
system
,
no
doubt
because
they
demanded
that
the
names
and
addresses
of
voters
be
put
at
the
bottom
of
each
ballot
.
24 15
Many
people
have
long
argued
that
democratization
in
the
Middle
East
will
not
get
far
until
Egypt
becomes
fully
engaged
in
the
process
.
34 15
Egypt
could
not
truly
set
out
on
a
path
of
democratization
without
first
amending
its
constitution
--
to
downsize
the
Pharaonic
powers
of
its
president
and
set
limits
on
his
term
in
office
.
14 8
Mubarak
,
after
all
,
is
already
in
his
24th
year
as
president
.
15 8
So
the
announcement
that
he
wants
competitive
presidential
elections
is
an
important
first
step
.
34 17
The
regime
may
assume
that
it
will
be
able
to
use
the
process
to
its
own
advantage
,
but
events
may
not
be
that
easy
to
control
once
people
begin
to
feel
empowered
.
9 6
The
democratic
genie
is
out
of
the
bottle
.
24 15
In
any
case
,
Egypt
is
not
the
only
country
in
this
troubled
region
that
is
now
embarking
on
the
road
of
democracy
.
20 9
Turkey
at
one
end
of
the
Middle
East
and
Morocco
at
the
other
are
already
well
on
their
way
.
33 16
The
real
groundswell
this
time
seems
to
have
come
from
the
close
timing
and
positive
outcomes
of
recent
elections
in
Iraq
,
Palestine
,
and
to
a
lesser
degree
in
Saudi
Arabia
.
27 13
The
unprecedented
demonstrations
against
Syria
's
occupation
of
Lebanon
following
the
assassination
of
its
former
prime
minister
,
Rafiq
al-Hariri
,
show
no
signs
of
abating
.
23 9
Egyptian
opposition
groups
,
too
,
have
staged
increasingly
bold
marches
and
other
forms
of
civil
disobedience
in
the
last
few
weeks
.
23 8
The
catalyst
for
their
anger
was
the
arrest
and
detention
of
the
ailing
opposition
leader
Ayman
Nour
at
the
end
of
January
.
26 11
The
government
's
heavy-handed
behavior
reinvigorated
the
homegrown
``
Kifaya
''
-LRB-
Enough
-RRB-
movement
,
which
has
demanded
an
end
to
the
Mubarak
regime
.
20 11
Suddenly
the
popular
wisdom
that
Egyptians
are
passive
and
afraid
to
act
did
not
seem
to
be
holding
up
.
21 9
An
alliance
of
local
,
regional
,
and
international
forces
is
uniting
against
tyranny-as-usual
on
the
banks
of
the
Nile
.
13 9
The
recent
wave
of
popular
pressure
appears
to
have
shaken
the
regime
.
16 6
Only
a
month
ago
,
Mubarak
dismissed
demands
for
constitutional
reform
as
``
futile
.
''
19 10
But
,
whatever
combination
of
events
brought
about
his
change
of
heart
,
election
initiative
should
be
welcomed
.
18 10
It
is
a
necessary
--
but
insufficient
--
first
step
for
overhauling
Egypt
's
stagnant
political
system
.
51 23
Egyptians
are
already
wary
of
token
reforms
à
la
Tunisia
,
where
longstanding
President
Zine
El
Abidin
Bin
Ali
created
a
caricature
of
a
constitutional
amendment
that
appeared
to
open
the
door
for
competitive
presidential
elections
,
but
then
staged
a
sham
contest
with
a
few
handpicked
``
opponents
.
''
22 8
In
previous
Tunisian
presidential
referenda
,
Bin
Ali
routinely
received
99
%
of
the
vote
;
he
now
got
96
%
.
12 13
Let
us
hope
that
Mubarak
is
more
serious
about
electoral
reform
.
36 21
As
a
measure
of
sincerity
,
he
needs
to
order
the
immediate
release
of
Ayman
Nour
and
take
steps
to
terminate
the
24-year-long
state
of
emergency
,
which
effectively
prevents
political
campaigning
from
taking
place
.
18 10
Mubarak
should
also
endorse
a
limit
of
no
more
than
two
successive
five-year
terms
for
any
president
.
20 11
Equally
necessary
are
confidence-building
measures
,
including
open
and
equal
access
to
the
media
,
which
are
now
state-controlled
.
23 17
I
have
announced
that
I
intend
to
contest
this
upcoming
presidential
election
as
a
way
of
opening
debate
on
these
essential
reforms
.
23 10
But
I
would
gladly
go
back
to
my
life
as
a
private
citizen
once
guaranteed
a
free
and
open
election
this
fall
.
12 7
If
seriously
implemented
,
these
steps
will
transform
Mubarak
's
legacy
.
26 9
Along
with
events
in
Lebanon
,
Iraq
,
and
Palestine
,
it
may
well
usher
in
an
Arab
spring
of
freedom
,
one
long
overdue
.
5 5
Historic
Election
in
Egypt
?
27 14
Egyptians
go
to
the
polls
on
September
7th
to
elect
a
president
from
among
ten
contenders
,
including
the
incumbent
of
24
years
,
Hosni
Mubarak
.
17 11
While
few
doubt
the
outcome
will
be
his
re-election
,
many
are
intensely
following
the
process
.
25 12
Some
6000
domestic
election
monitors
have
been
training
for
the
event
,
while
hundreds
of
foreign
reporters
are
converging
on
the
country
this
week
.
22 8
Although
all
the
formal
trappings
of
a
true
electoral
contest
are
in
place
,
important
aspects
of
authenticity
are
glaringly
absent
.
15 7
Despite
promises
to
the
contrary
,
this
is
far
from
a
level
playing
field
.
25 8
Mubarak
still
commands
disproportionate
assets
:
name
recognition
,
a
virtual
monopoly
on
state-controlled
electronic
media
and
some
85
%
of
the
print
media
.
21 9
One
week
before
the
poll
,
some
opposition
candidates
have
yet
to
air
even
one
campaign
ad
on
Egyptian
television
.
21 7
All
members
of
the
presidential
election
commission
are
Mubarak
appointees
,
and
the
new
election
rules
eliminated
any
independent
challengers
.
23 9
Since
the
year
2000
,
Egypt
's
8000
judges
must
supervise
and
certify
election
results
,
by
ruling
of
the
High
Court
.
28 12
This
was
a
major
step
toward
fairer
elections
,
as
the
judges
'
professional
union
has
remained
fairly
independent
over
the
past
half-century
of
executive
power
grabs
.
17 13
So
the
Mubarak
regime
has
had
to
use
various
ploys
to
neutralize
the
judge
's
union
.
29 19
One
was
to
stretch
the
definition
of
`
the
judiciary
'
to
include
thousands
of
loyal
government
employees
who
have
law
degrees
but
no
experience
on
the
bench
.
33 12
This
boxes
in
the
true
judges
,
for
if
they
protest
by
boycotting
their
supervisory
duties
,
the
task
will
fall
once
more
to
police
from
the
infamous
Ministry
of
the
Interior
.
19 9
Thus
,
in
the
past
,
the
judges
'
union
tended
to
go
along
,
with
predictable
results
.
40 11
In
the
2000
parliamentary
elections
,
while
Mubarak
's
ruling
party
received
roughly
38
%
of
the
popular
vote
in
districts
supervised
by
true
judges
,
that
percent
somehow
jumped
to
86
%
where
the
quasi-judges
were
in
charge
.
8 8
This
year
promises
to
be
very
different
.
40 11
In
the
spring
the
judges
held
a
nation-wide
assembly
and
resolved
that
unless
the
regime
granted
them
full
independence
,
and
exclusive
oversight
of
the
voting
process
they
would
not
supervise
the
upcoming
presidential
-LRB-
or
parliamentary
-RRB-
races
.
57 14
On
September
2nd
they
made
their
final
demands
:
allow
civil
society
groups
to
observe
the
voting
process
,
stop
interfering
in
the
definition
of
legitimate
judges
for
purposes
of
the
election
,
and
agree
that
no
ballot
box
will
leave
the
presence
of
a
legitimate
judge
until
its
contents
are
counted
,
certified
and
reported
.
33 14
Thus
far
,
a
standoff
looks
likely
,
as
the
head
of
the
presidential
election
commission
has
stated
publicly
on
Egyptian
television
that
he
refuses
all
citizen
monitoring
of
the
election
process
.
25 12
Other
interesting
developments
on
the
eve
of
the
election
include
a
fierce
public
debate
over
whether
to
vote
or
to
boycott
the
presidential
race
.
22 16
Several
opposition
parties
have
called
on
their
members
to
stay
away
in
protest
over
restrictive
election
rules
that
strongly
favor
Mubarak
.
45 12
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
,
thought
to
be
the
single
strongest
opposition
group
in
Egypt
,
are
urging
their
followers
to
caste
ballots
and
vote
their
conscience
but
not
to
give
support
to
any
`
despotic
,
corrupt
rulers
.
'
17 10
This
is
a
clear
if
implicit
repudiation
of
Mubarak
,
the
sole
ruler
for
24
years
.
20 10
Some
34
civil
society
organizations
are
preparing
thousands
of
young
Egyptians
to
monitor
the
elections
despite
repeated
governmental
objections
.
32 14
These
groups
argue
that
if
the
regime
is
not
planning
to
rig
the
vote
,
then
domestic
as
well
as
foreign
observation
of
the
polling
process
should
not
be
a
problem
.
31 16
The
regime
response
is
to
say
that
any
outside
monitoring
is
an
infringement
on
Egyptian
sovereignty
,
and
that
domestic
monitors
are
an
affront
to
the
integrity
of
the
judges
.
18 10
That
argument
was
quickly
undermined
when
the
judges
'
union
announced
their
support
for
civil
society

Whether
the
Mubarak
regime
is
running
scared
because
of
the
mounting
challenges
from
within
and
without
to
hold
a
free
and
fair
election
,
or
is
simply
incapable
of
ridding
the
party
of
cheating
as
a
way
of
life
,
the
present
signs
do
not
bode
well
for
next
Wednesday
's
polls
.

Meanwhile
,
Egyptians
for
the
first
time
are
experiencing
the
thrilling
taste
of
defying
tyranny
,
and
enjoying
some
newly-found
space
for
freedom
.

Europe
's
Dollar
Envy
Currencies
can
become
the
focus
not
just
for
commercial
transactions
,
but
for
diplomatic
and
political
wrangles
.
15 6
When
this
happens
,
commercial
transactions
become
more
difficult
and
subject
to
greater
uncertainty
.
12 8
The
politicization
of
money
during
the
interwar
depression
was
economically
devastating
.
12 8
But
there
have
been
more
recent
occurrences
of
nasty
currency
wars
.
16 7
In
the
1960
's
the
international
monetary
order
became
the
focus
of
a
political
tug-of-war
.
14 11
Each
side
had
quite
different
theories
and
explanations
of
what
was
going
on
.
26 11
The
Europeans
--
in
particular
the
French
--
complained
about
what
General
Charles
de
Gaulle
termed
the
``
exorbitant
privilege
''
of
the
US
dollar
.
51 19
The
General
and
his
monetary
guru
,
Jacques
Rueff
,
argued
that
the
US
used
the
dollar
's
status
as
the
major
reserve
currency
of
the
Bretton
Woods
fixed
exchange-rate
regime
in
order
to
run
deficits
and
pay
for
its
overseas
military
adventurism
-LRB-
at
that
time
in
Vietnam
-RRB-
.
26 14
France
responded
with
calls
for
monetary
reform
that
would
end
the
peculiar
role
of
the
dollar
and
tried
to
revive
the
largely
discredited
gold
standard
.
26 19
Europeans
began
a
long
discussion
of
the
advantages
of
monetary
union
,
achievement
of
which
would
allow
them
to
look
the
dollar
in
the
face
.
18 7
But
from
the
American
point
of
view
,
the
international
role
of
the
dollar
was
a
trap
.
18 7
Other
countries
could
change
their
exchange
rates
,
and
in
this
way
could
maintain
greater
export
competitiveness
.
33 16
The
US
government
was
powerless
in
the
face
of
an
undervalued
yen
,
fueling
the
belief
that
the
rest
of
the
world
was
using
the
dollar
to
attack
America
's
manufacturing
base
.
40 19
The
Nixon
administration
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
to
save
the
American
economy
was
to
engage
in
monetary
unilateralism
--
a
monetary
expansion
so
dramatic
that
other
countries
would
be
forced
into
adjusting
their
exchange
rates
.
10 6
These
long-forgotten
battles
seem
suddenly
very
immediate
once
again
.
26 9
The
world
no
longer
has
a
fixed
exchange-rate
regime
,
but
the
dollar
remains
the
major
reserve
currency
--
a
sort
of
floating
Bretton
Woods
.
29 12
For
Americans
the
reserve
role
of
the
dollar
is
a
potential
threat
,
while
for
non-Americans
it
is
yet
another
instance
of
an
American
neo-imperial
quest
for
hegemony
.
26 12
In
this
decade
,
China
has
taken
the
place
of
1960
's
Japan
,
holding
its
exchange
rate
down
in
order
to
push
export
growth
.
34 22
Consequently
it
is
the
target
of
US
complaints
about
unfair
competition
,
and
of
efforts
to
force
an
exchange-rate
adjustment
that
would
deter
Americans
from
buying
Chinese
toys
,
appliances
,
and
clothing
.
19 12
Manufacturers
in
the
US
have
decided
that
Chinese-made
bras
constitute
a
threat
to
the
American
way
of
life
.
37 12
Meanwhile
,
Europeans
-LRB-
especially
the
French
-RRB-
complain
about
the
big
US
deficits
,
and
de
Gaulle
's
argument
that
the
rest
of
the
world
is
paying
for
America
's
wars
is
in
fashion
again
.
38 21
Some
Europeans
suggest
that
Asian
central
banks
should
hold
a
greater
part
of
their
reserves
in
euros
,
an
echo
of
the
General
's
unsuccessful
attempt
to
force
America
to
its
knees
by
selling
dollars
for
gold
.
28 12
The
1960
's
ended
in
the
breakdown
of
the
``
system
,
''
and
in
major
financial
turbulence
,
accompanied
by
an
inflationary
surge
of
commodity
prices
.
14 7
Everyone
was
hurt
,
and
America
's
role
in
world
affairs
was
shaken
.
13 10
A
similar
collapse
now
is
likely
to
have
a
rather
different
effect
.
15 7
The
floating-rate
system
of
today
is
stronger
and
the
costs
of
adjustment
differently
distributed
.
26 13
Most
Americans
do
not
suffer
greatly
from
the
dollar
's
sharp
fall
,
as
foreign
sellers
have
to
make
price
adjustments
for
the
US
market
.
18 9
Asian
economies
are
growing
vigorously
,
and
their
central
banks
are
building
up
claims
on
the
US
.
29 17
They
are
likely
to
continue
this
policy
,
as
the
alternative
would
be
a
sudden
setback
to
the
competitiveness
of
their
export
sectors
in
the
all-important
US
market
.
21 14
This
gives
the
US
a
longer
time
to
address
a
current
account
deficit
that
is
in
the
long
run
unsustainable
.
31 14
The
economically
dynamic
regions
of
the
world
--
North
America
and
Asia
--
are
thus
linked
together
in
a
pact
that
will
ensure
the
continued
centrality
of
the
American
dollar
.
15 12
Americans
will
continue
to
pile
up
debt
because
Asians
want
them
to
do
that
.
13 9
To
abrogate
the
pact
would
be
against
the
interest
of
both
parties
.
13 11
This
is
not
American
unilateralism
,
because
it
means
working
with
Asia
.
19 11
But
to
Europeans
,
who
are
excluded
from
the
pact
,
it
looks
like
monetary
and
economic
unilateralism
.
20 8
In
the
meantime
,
the
rise
of
the
euro
against
the
dollar
creates
substantial
European
pain
for
manufacturing
exporters
.
13 13
Europe
,
however
,
is
unable
to
do
much
to
gain
relief
.
14 8
Indeed
,
Europe
will
be
the
major
sufferer
in
the
new
currency
clashes
.
34 11
Answers
that
were
touted
in
the
1960
's
--
revival
of
the
gold
standard
,
or
the
invention
of
a
common
European
currency
--
do
not
appear
to
be
very
helpful
any
more
.
13 10
Having
a
single
currency
has
turned
out
not
to
afford
substantial
protection
.
23 10
The
old
version
of
the
European
response
--
what
psychologists
might
call
``
dollar
envy
''
--
will
only
become
more
acute
.
36 12
There
will
be
appeals
to
the
European
Central
Bank
to
expand
the
monetary
base
,
as
if
imitating
the
dollar
were
the
answer
to
all
the
industrial
,
structural
,
and
demographic
problems
plaguing
Europe
.
19 11
But
a
moment
's
reflection
should
remind
us
that
Europe
's
problems
are
not
amenable
to
currency
manipulation
.
28 16
Protesting
the
new
version
of
America
's
exorbitant
monetary
privilege
should
be
seen
for
what
it
is
:
a
way
of
compensating
for
a
real
European
powerlessness
.
36 17
So
dollar
envy
is
here
to
stay
,
and
it
will
become
even
greater
as
the
greenback
's
international
value
melts
away
without
any
obviously
bad
effects
on
the
people
who
print
and
use
it
.
34 18
An
Epidemic
of
Politics
Americans
,
like
citizens
in
countries
throughout
the
world
,
have
come
to
accept
that
politics
plays
an
important
role
in
the
appointment
of
certain
kinds
of
public
officials
.
48 22
Few
of
us
are
surprised
-LRB-
though
some
may
be
disappointed
-RRB-
when
a
federal
judgeship
is
awarded
or
a
senior
diplomat
appointed
because
the
candidate
passes
a
litmus
test
of
loyalty
to
some
principle
that
is
important
to
the
President
's
or
Prime
Minister
's
party
.
30 13
But
science
,
almost
everyone
agrees
,
is
different
,
and
here
the
United
States
is
beginning
to
stand
as
a
cautionary
example
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
15 10
Scientific
appointments
should
rest
on
objective
criteria
of
training
,
ability
,
and
performance
.
24 11
Clearly
,
it
is
legitimate
to
interrogate
a
future
Secretary
of
Health
and
Human
Services
-LRB-
HHS
-RRB-
about
his
views
on
abortion
.
21 12
But
it
is
entirely
out
of
place
when
appointees
to
scientific
advisory
committees
are
subjected
to
tests
of
political
loyalty
.
39 15
Similarly
,
membership
of
bodies
that
conduct
peer
review
of
scientific
proposals
-
a
process
that
is
fundamental
to
scientific
progress
-
surely
ought
to
be
free
of
all
barriers
to
entry
that
are
unrelated
to
professional
qualifications
.
17 7
Unfortunately
,
scientists
in
the
US
are
running
up
against
such
barriers
more
and
more
often
.
17 8
During
the
past
fall
,
the
journal
Science
published
several
news
stories
related
to
the
issue
.
40 11
One
involved
the
wholesale
replacement
of
members
of
the
advisory
committee
to
the
National
Center
for
Environmental
Health
,
a
part
of
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
-LRB-
CDC
-RRB-
,
without
consulting
the
center
's
director
.
31 8
Similar
cases
involved
the
CDC
's
Advisory
Committee
on
Lead
Poisoning
and
Prevention
,
the
Advisory
Committee
on
National
Human
Research
Protections
,
and
the
Advisory
Committee
on
Genetic
Testing
.
34 12
The
current
epidemic
of
ideology
,
in
which
advisory
committees
are
shut
down
and
reassembled
with
new
members
,
and
candidates
are
subjected
to
loyalty
tests
,
seems
old
hat
to
some
observers
.
12 6
Officials
at
the
HHS
call
it
``
fairly
standard
practice
.
''
17 8
Well
,
it
is
n't
standard
practice
in
America
-
or
at
least
it
was
n't
.
24 10
In
any
case
,
what
's
really
worrisome
is
not
that
the
Bush
administration
examines
candidates
for
compatibility
with
its
``
values
.
''
25 18
The
most
alarming
development
is
how
deep
the
ideological
vetting
now
cuts
,
invading
areas
that
once
were
immune
to
this
kind
of
manipulation
.
37 12
Indeed
,
perhaps
the
most
telling
case
in
the
widening
political
epidemic
was
a
membership
re-shuffle
of
the
study
section
at
the
National
Institute
of
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
that
evaluates
grants
for
studying
workplace
injuries
.
16 11
Advisory
committees
might
have
been
vulnerable
to
occasional
stacking
of
this
kind
in
the
past
.
17 11
After
all
,
they
recommend
the
policies
that
politicians
may
or
may
not
want
to
consider
.
4 5
But
study
sections
?
17 9
In
October
2002
,
Science
published
an
editorial
by
David
Michaels
and
a
group
of
colleagues
.
35 17
Several
were
distinguished
former
public
servants
who
had
been
involved
with
some
of
the
committees
in
question
,
and
they
brought
a
valuable
perspective
to
the
issue
,
one
based
on
their
personal
experience
.
16 8
Their
piece
was
a
story
in
itself
,
but
what
followed
was
even
more
interesting
.
15 12
It
set
off
a
volley
of
letters
in
which
scientists
told
of
similar
experiences
.
25 10
A
nominee
for
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
's
Muscular
Dystrophy
Research
Coordinating
Committee
told
of
being
vetted
by
a
White
House
staff
member
.
38 15
After
being
asked
about
her
views
on
various
Bush
administration
policies
,
none
of
them
related
to
the
work
of
the
committee
,
she
was
asked
whether
she
supports
the
president
's
policy
on
embryonic
stem
cells
.
33 13
Another
letter
writer
,
a
distinguished
professor
of
psychiatry
and
psychology
,
reported
receiving
a
call
from
the
White
House
about
his
nomination
to
serve
on
the
National
Council
on
Drug
Abuse
.
25 22
The
caller
declared
that
he
must
vet
him
to
``
determine
whether
he
held
any
views
that
might
be
embarrassing
to
the
president
.
''
21 8
According
to
the
professor
,
a
series
of
questions
followed
,
with
the
White
House
official
keeping
a
running
score
.
31 14
One
example
:
``
You
're
two
for
three
;
the
president
opposes
needle
exchange
-LSB-
for
intravenous
drug
users
-RSB-
on
moral
grounds
,
regardless
of
the
outcome
.
''
10 6
Then
the
exchange
took
an
even
more
chilling
turn
.
34 11
The
official
asked
the
nominee
whether
he
had
voted
for
Bush
,
and
,
on
being
informed
that
he
had
not
,
asked
:
``
Why
did
n't
you
support
the
president
?
''
10 8
This
is
the
stuff
of
dictatorship
,
not
democracy
.
18 10
The
purpose
of
scientific
advisory
committees
is
to
provide
balanced
,
thoughtful
advice
to
the
policy
process
.
18 10
Nothing
is
gained
-
and
much
is
lost
-
when
a
desired
policy
outcome
is
put
first
.
22 12
This
is
why
deciding
which
research
projects
to
support
has
always
been
a
matter
for
objective
peer
review
,
not
politicians
.
33 9
In
fact
,
the
applicable
statute
for
all
this
-
the
Federal
Advisory
Committee
Act
-
specifically
requires
that
committees
be
balanced
and
``
not
inappropriately
influenced
by
the
appointing
authority
.
''
26 11
US
Health
and
Human
Services
Secretary
Tommy
Thompson
and
the
White
House
Personnel
Office
ought
to
set
an
example
to
the
rest
of
the
world
.
12 9
They
can
do
so
very
easily
:
by
following
the
law
.
28 17
A
Murder
in
Moscow
It
is
time
to
end
the
fiction
that
Vladimir
Putin
's
``
dictatorship
of
law
''
has
made
postcommunist
Russia
any
less
lawless
.
55 19
The
murder
of
Anna
Politkovskaya
,
one
of
Russia
's
bravest
and
best
journalists
,
a
woman
who
dared
to
expose
the
brutal
murders
committed
by
Russian
troops
in
Chechnya
,
is
final
proof
that
President
Putin
has
delivered
nothing
more
than
a
run
of
the
mill
dictatorship
with
the
usual
contempt
for
law
.
15 11
This
recognition
is
a
timely
one
for
the
world
to
make
,
particularly
Europe
.
35 20
Germany
's
Foreign
Ministry
is
preparing
a
policy
on
Russian/German
relations
that
will
enshrine
indifference
to
Putin
's
lawlessness
as
being
in
the
national
interest
of
the
most
powerful
member
of
the
European
Union
.
29 18
But
indifference
becomes
appeasement
when
it
encourages
Putin
to
pursue
his
lawless
ways
in
the
international
arena
,
as
in
his
current
campaign
to
strangle
Georgia
's
economy
.
29 11
The
killing
of
Politkovskaya
has
incited
an
eerie
sense
of
déjà
vu
:
just
as
in
the
KGB
's
heyday
,
people
simply
disappear
in
Putin
's
Russia
.
12 7
Politkovskaya
's
is
the
third
politically
tinged
killing
in
three
weeks
.
20 9
Enver
Ziganshin
,
the
chief
engineer
of
BP
Russia
,
was
shot
to
death
in
Irkutsk
on
September
30
.
26 12
Andrei
Kozlov
,
the
deputy
governor
of
Russia
's
central
bank
who
was
leading
a
campaign
against
financial
fraud
,
was
assassinated
on
September
14
.
44 17
The
fact
that
Russia
's
Prosecutor
General
Yuri
Chaika
,
took
over
the
investigation
into
Politkovskaya
's
killing
,
as
he
did
with
the
murder
of
Kozlov
,
does
n't
inspire
hope
,
as
such
senior
level
involvement
would
in
any
real
democracy
.
25 9
In
fact
,
the
involvement
of
the
highest
level
of
Russia
's
government
is
almost
a
guarantee
that
the
killers
will
never
be
found
.
22 15
Politkovskaya
's
murder
is
a
particularly
grim
augury
when
you
consider
that
she
was
a
powerful
critic
of
Russia
's
President
.
61 13
In
her
articles
for
one
of
the
few
remaining
independent
papers

Novaya
Gazeta

in
her
books
``
Putin

Life
in
a
Failing
Democracy
''
and
``
A

War

A
Russian

,
''
Politkovskaya
wrote
of
the
vanishing
freedoms
that
are
the
signature
characteristic
of
Putin
's
presidency
.
40 13
As
shown
by
the
exile
of
the
former
media
tycoons
Boris
Berezovsky
and
Vladimir
Gusinky
,
and
the
imprisonment
of
oil
magnate
Mikhail
Khodorkovsky
,
three
fates
await
Putin
's
enemies
:
exile
,
imprisonment
,
or
the
grave
.
14 10
I
am
not
accusing
Putin
's
government
of
the
contract
killing
of
Politkovskaya
.
41 13
After
all
,
as
a
campaigning
investigative
journalist
she
made
many
people
angry
besides
Putin
,
not
least
of
which
is
the
current
Chechen
Prime
Minister
,
Ramzan
Kadyrov
,
whom
she
accused
of
a
policy
of
kidnapping
for
ransom
.
44 18
But
even
if
Vladimir
Putin
's
associates
had
nothing
to
do
with
Politkovskaya
being
gunned
down
in
an
elevator
of
her
apartment
building
in
the
center
of
Moscow
,
his
contempt
for
law
created
the
climate
in
which
the
murder
was
carried
out
.
30 10
Like
the
murder
of
Archbishop
Thomas
Beckett
in
his
Canterbury
Cathedral
many
centuries
ago
,
the
crime
was
committed
in
the
clear
belief
that
it
would
please
the
king
.
32 12
Given
what
Politkovskaya
represented
--
the
responsibility
of
a
democratic
press
to
question
the
Kremlin
and
its
policies
--
the
government
should
have
made
certain
that
nothing
bad
happened
to
her
.
17 9
Putin
's
Russia
has
already
lost
12
leading
journalists
to
murder
in
the
past
six
years
.
30 16
None
of
those
crimes
has
been
solved
,
which
would
not
be
the
case
if
Putin
's
``
dictatorship
of
law
''
was
anything
more
than
a
PR
strategy
.
20 9
The
six
year
period
since
Vladimir
Putin
arrived
in
the
Kremlin
has
been
a
time
of
deeply
conflicting
signals
.
34 18
On
one
hand
,
the
world
sees
a
young
,
educated
leader
pledging
to
modernize
Russia
,
particularly
in
terms
of
bringing
its
law
enforcement
and
judicial
practices
into
line
with
international
norms
.
47 11
On
the
other
,
the
president
watches
in
silence
while
his
ex-colleagues
in
Russia
's
FSB
security
service
-LRB-
the
former
KGB
-RRB-
provide
no
security
to
those
murdered
,
and
launch
a
series
of
notorious
espionage
cases
against
journalists
,
scientists
,
and
environmental
activists
.
26 6
These
``
neo-spies
''
include
journalist
Gregory
Pasko
,
arms
control
expert
Igor
Sutyagin
,
diplomat
Valentin
Moiseyev
,
physicist
Valentin
Danilov
,
and
others
.
31 12
The
supposedly
civilizing
influence
of
being
a
Western
partner
--
chairing
a
G-8
summit
in
Saint
Petersburg
for
example
--
seems
to
have
been
lost
on
Putin
's
Kremlin
cabal
.
33 10
Once
again
exposure
to
Western
values
has
delivered
another
Potemkin
Village
;
Russia
presents
a
façade
of
laws
and
democratic
institutions
,
but
behind
that
cardboard
surface
the
same
arbitrary
brutes
rule
.
14 9
The
danger
for
the
world
is
that
Putin
's
lawlessness
is
being
exported
.
15 7
Across
Russia
's
near
abroad
,
a
form
of
criminalized
diplomacy
is
taking
root
.
29 10
Look
at
Putin
's
attempt
to
rig
Ukraine
's
previous
presidential
election
,
and
the
on
again
off
again
criminal
charges
brought
against
the
opposition
leader
Yuliya
Tymoshenko
.
20 12
Look
at
the
rogue
breakaway
regions
in
Moldova
and
Georgia
that
exist
only
because
of
the
Kremlin
's
backing
.
16 15
Look
at
how
the
Kremlin
seeks
to
blackmail
its
neighbors
by
threatening
their
energy
supplies
.
14 10
Every
policeman
knows
that
when
you
ignore
criminal
behavior
,
criminals
grow
bolder
.
27 20
It
is
past
time
for
the
world
to
recognize
Vladimir
Putin
for
what
he
is
:
a
man
who
is
taking
Russia
back
into
the
shadows
.
39 17
So
the
world
must
now
ponder
that
old
Latin
maxim
qui
tacet
consentere
videtur
--
silence
means
consent
--
and
ask
itself
if
it
is
wise
to
quietly
consent
to
Putin
's
construction
of
a
lawless
energy
superpower
.
49 21
Russia
's
Pipeline
to
Empire
Gerhard
Schroeder
,
who
less
than
a
month
ago
was
Germany
's
Chancellor
,
has
agreed
to
become
chairman
of
the
company
that
is
building
a
gas
pipeline
from
Russia
,
across
the
Baltic
Sea
to
Germany
,
and
on
through
Western
Europe
.
17 12
In
many
countries
,
Schroeder
would
now
be
charged
with
the
crime
of
conflict
of
interest
.
46 20
His
apparent
ethical
lapse
is
magnified
by
the
fact
that
,
at
this
very
moment
,
Russia
is
threatening
to
cut
off
Ukraine
's
gas
supplies
if
that
country
does
not
give
in
to
the
pricing
demands
of
Kremlin
's
state-owned
gas
behemoth
,
Gazprom
.
35 11
Russia
's
strategic
task
is
obvious
:
cutting
off
Ukraine
's
gas
currently
means
cutting
off
much
of
Europe
's
gas
as
well
,
because
some
of
its
biggest
gas
pipelines
pass
through
Ukraine
.
31 11
By
circumventing
Ukraine
,
Poland
,
and
of
course
,
the
Baltic
countries
,
the
new
pipeline
promises
greater
leverage
to
the
Kremlin
as
it
seeks
to
reassert
itself
regionally
.
29 17
President
Vladimir
Putin
and
his
administration
of
ex-KGB
clones
will
no
longer
have
to
worry
about
Western
Europe
when
deciding
how
hard
to
squeeze
Russia
's
postcommunist
neighbors
.
12 8
Should
Europe
really
be
providing
Putin
with
this
new
imperial
weapon
?
12 6
Worse
,
might
Russia
turn
this
weapon
on
an
energy-addicted
EU
?
38 19
That
a
German
ex-chancellor
is
going
to
lead
the
company
that
could
provide
Russia
with
a
means
to
manipulate
the
EU
economy
is
testimony
to
Europe
's
dangerous
complacency
in
the
face
of
Putin
's
neo-imperialist
ambitions
.
15 9
Certainly
Russia
's
media
are
aware
of
Europe
's
growing
dependence
on
Russian
energy
.
29 8
Indeed
,
they
revel
in
it
:
after
we
integrate
and
increase
our
common
gas
business
,
Russian
editorialists
write
,
Europe
will
keep
silent
about
human
rights
.
23 11
Putin
expresses
this
stance
in
a
more
oblique
way
with
his
commitment
to
pursuing
what
he
calls
an
``
independent
policy
.
''
26 14
What
he
means
by
that
is
that
Russia
is
to
be
``
independent
''
of
the
moral
and
human
rights
concerns
of
the
Western
democracies
.
28 19
Perhaps
some
European
leaders
really
do
believe
that
maintaining
the
Union
's
cozy
prosperity
justifies
silencing
ourselves
on
human
rights
and
other
issues
that
annoy
the
Kremlin
.
71 14
Of
course
,
we
may
speak
up
,
briefly
,
about
``
commercial
''
matters
like
the
expropriation
of
Yukos
,
but
if
the
Kremlin
puts
a
price
on
our
values
or
criticism
of
Russian
wrongdoing
--
as
in
,
say
,
bloodstained
Chechnya
--
Europeans
seem
willing
to
shut
up
rather
than
face
the
possibility
of
higher
energy
prices
,
or
even
a
blockade
like
that
now
facing
Ukraine
.
29 10
As
Putin
shuffles
his
court
,
subordinating
the
Duma
to
his
will
,
the
EU
's
hopes
for
a
growing
``
Europeanization
''
of
Russia
should
be
abandoned
.
27 9
The
Russia
that
Putin
is
building
has
mutated
from
the
post-Soviet
hopes
of
freedom
into
an
oil
and
gas
bulwark
for
his
new
model
ex-KGB
elite
.
23 9
Indeed
,
Matthias
Warnig
,
the
chief
executive
of
the
pipeline
consortium
that
Schroeder
will
chair
,
is
a
longtime
Putin
friend
.
54 16
The
Wall
Street
Journal
reported
earlier
this
year
that
Warnig
,
who
heads
Dresdner
Bank
's
Russian
arm
,
was
an
officer
in
the
Stasi
,
the
East
German
secret
police
,
and
met
Putin
in
the
late
1980
's
when
the
Russian
president
was
based
in
East
Germany
as
a
KGB
spy
.
34 15
That
Russians
tolerate
a
government
of
ex-KGB
men
,
for
whom
lack
of
compassion
and
intolerance
of
dissent
are
the
norm
,
reflects
their
exhaustion
from
the
tumult
of
the
last
20
years
.
52 18
Now
the
Kremlin
seems
to
think
that
what
is
good
for
ordinary
Russians
is
good
for
independent
nations
as
well
:
small
and
weak
countries
will
be
shown
no
mercy
once
Russia
is
given
the
tools
to
intimidate
,
isolate
,
and
threaten
them
with
the
prospect
of
an
energy
blockade
.
17 10
As
a
former
Head
of
State
of
newly
independent
Lithuania
,
I
frequently
endured
such
threats
.
21 13
The
EU
has
signed
numerous
agreements
with
Russia
including
one
for
a
``
common
space
''
for
freedom
and
justice
.
10 9
The
Kremlin
is
very
good
at
feigning
such
idealism
.
35 10
Its
control
of
Eastern
Europe
was
always
enforced
on
the
basis
of
``
friendship
treaties
,
''
and
the
Soviet
invasions
of
Hungary
in
1956
and
Czechoslovakia
in
1968
were
``
fraternal
''
missions
.
48 13
But
look
how
Putin
abuses
that
``
common
''
space
:
barbaric
treatment
of
Chechens
,
the
businessmen
Mikhail
Khodorkovsky
imprisoned
,
foreign
NGO
's
hounded
,
a
co-leader
of
last
year
's
Orange
Revolution
,
Yuliya
Tymoshenko
,
indicted
by
Russian
military
prosecutors
on
trumped-up
charges
.
32 14
If
Europeans
are
serious
about
their
common
space
for
human
rights
and
freedoms
,
they
must
recognize
that
those
values
are
not
shared
by
the
calculating
placemen
of
Putin
's
Kremlin
.
16 14
The
same
is
true
of
viewing
Russia
as
an
ally
in
the
fight
against
terrorism
.
49 17
Is
it
really
conceivable
that
the
homeland
of
the
``
Red
Terror
''
with
countless
unpunished
crimes
from
the
Soviet
era
,
and
which
bears
traces
of
blood
from
Lithuania
to
the
Caucasus
,
will
provide
reliable
help
in
stopping
Iran
and
North
Korea
from
threatening
the
world
?
26 16
It
seems
more
likely
that
the
Kremlin
's
cold
minds
will
merely
exploit
each
crisis
as
an
opportunity
to
increase
their
destructive
power
and
influence
.
15 9
For
decades
,
my
region
of
Europe
was
left
to
the
mercy
of
evil
.
17 11
So
I
can
not
sit
back
in
silence
as
Europe
stumbles
blindly
into
a
new
appeasement
.
26 10
We
,
the
new
democracies
of
Eastern
Europe
,
have
been
taught
by
our
legacy
that
behind
Russia
's
every
diplomatic
act
lurks
imperial
ambition
.
15 10
Western
Europeans
,
who
have
been
spared
this
legacy
,
should
heed
our
warnings
.
27 12
Dependence
on
Russia
--
even
if
its
face
is
now
that
of
the
allegedly
``
charismatic
''
Gerhard
Schroeder
--
will
only
lead
to
an
abyss
.
54 18
Iraq
's
Bullets
and
Ballots
When
the
Iraq
war
started
in
2003
,
the
Bush
administration
had
very
ambitious
plans
:
as
in
post-1945
Germany
and
Japan
,
a
long
and
peaceful
occupation
was
envisaged
,
during
which
expanding
oil
production
would
assure
rising
prosperity
as
democratic
structures
were
built
piece
by
piece
.
25 17
The
foundation
was
to
be
a
liberal
,
even
post-modern
constitution
,
complete
with
a
guarantee
of
25
%
of
parliamentary
seats
for
women
.
13 6
In
today
's
Iraq
,
there
is
no
peace
and
no
prosperity
.
22 11
The
constitution
that
will
be
voted
on
October
15th
includes
that
25
%
rule
,
but
otherwise
is
far
from
liberal
.
36 11
The
key
provision
-LRB-
article
2
-RRB-
that
no
law
may
contradict
``
the
undisputed
rules
of
Islam
''
violates
the
basic
principle
of
parliamentary
sovereignty
,
and
will
prevent
legislation
from
meeting
international
standards
.
25 12
For
example
,
the
age
of
sexual
consent
for
girls
can
not
be
set
above
nine
,
because
Muhhamad
himself
had
a
nine-year-old
wife
.
26 13
It
follows
that
nine-year-old
girls
are
also
adults
in
criminal
law
,
and
subject
to
capital
punishment
for
,
say
,
converting
to
another
religion
.
36 19
More
broadly
,
the
Shias
can
use
this
provision
to
place
their
ayatollahs
over
the
elected
parliament
,
as
in
Iran
,
because
they
alone
are
authorized
to
determine
the
``
rules
''
of
Islam
.
63 18
Outsiders
and
the
few
Iraqi
liberals
worry
mainly
about
this
Islamic
provision
,
but
the
widespread
Sunni
opposition
to
the
constitution
is
aimed
at
other
provisions
:
the
exclusion
of
the
``
Saddamist
Ba'ath
Party
''
from
political
life
and
government
,
and
the
federalist
provisions
that
grant
autonomy
to
the
18
Iraqi
provinces
and
allow
them
to
combine
into
regional
governments
.
33 14
The
exclusion
rule
is
a
personal
issue
for
elite
Sunnis
--
including
thousands
of
businessmen
,
professionals
,
even
artists
--
because
,
with
few
exceptions
,
they
were
all
Ba'ath
members
.
16 11
In
theory
,
the
constitutional
prohibition
could
be
interpreted
as
applying
only
to
the
future
.
29 14
But
in
practice
administrative
rules
are
now
being
applied
to
exclude
so-called
``
high-ranking
''
Ba'ath
members
from
any
form
of
government
employment
,
and
thousands
are
affected
.
16 10
The
Sunnis
would
probably
accept
the
federalist
provisions
if
they
applied
only
to
the
Kurds
.
57 15
They
know
that
the
alternative
is
not
a
return
to
centralism
,
but
secession
by
the
three
Kurdish-majority
provinces
of
Dahuk
,
Arbil
,
and
As
Sulaymaniyah
to
form
an
independent
Kurdistan
,
with
its
own
treasury
,
army
-LRB-
the
Pesh
Merga
-RRB-
,
and
oil
production
around
Kirkuk
--
the
second-largest
reserves
in
Iraq
.
38 16
Sunnis
reject
the
same
federalism
for
the
Shias
because
they
view
them
as
fellow
Arabs
who
have
always
accepted
Sunni
rule
in
the
past
,
and
will
do
so
again
--
unless
they
have
their
own
government
.
35 17
That
is
what
the
new
constitution
would
allow
,
because
the
Shia-majority
provinces
in
the
south
--
which
contain
the
greater
part
of
Iraq
's
oil
reserves
--
could
form
their
own
regional
government
.
22 8
In
the
usual
style
of
the
Middle
East
,
disappointed
Sunni
leaders
,
unhappy
with
the
constitution
,
now
threaten
violence
.
15 8
But
federalism
is
not
the
reason
why
Sunni
supremacists
and
Islamists
launch
deadly
attacks
.
17 9
Their
opposition
is
more
elemental
:
they
do
not
accept
the
principle
of
democratic
majority
rule
.
10 8
Instead
,
they
seek
to
restore
Sunni
minority
rule
.
13 6
For
the
Islamists
,
all
Shias
deserve
death
anyway
,
as
apostates
.
12 5
One
Shia
leader
,
Moqtada
Sadr
,
also
vehemently
opposes
federalism
.
43 14
His
followers
are
the
largely
illiterate
,
poorest
,
and
most
violent
Shias
of
the
slums
of
Baghdad
and
beyond
,
whose
``
Mahdi
militia
''
fought
American
troops
in
2004
,
even
while
the
Americans
were
protecting
Shias
from
Sunni
attackers
.
35 11
As
a
very
junior
priest
who
derives
his
authority
from
his
dead
Ayatollah
father
--
himself
a
populist
--
Sadr
is
opposed
by
Iraq
's
living
Ayatollahs
,
who
despise
his
ignorance
and
violence
.
39 12
Sadr
can
not
possibly
compete
with
them
in
religious
authority
,
so
he
takes
an
Arab-nationalist
stance
against
them
,
often
recalling
that
the
highest
Shia
cleric
,
Ayatollah
Sistani
,
is
a
Persian
,
not
an
Arab
.
59 18
Similarly
,
he
reminds
his
followers
that
the
El
Hakims
,
who
head
the
Supreme
Council
for
the
Islamic
Revolution
in
Iraq
-LRB-
SCIRI
-RRB-
,
and
their
``
Badr
''
militia
were
subsidized
exiles
in
Iran
--
many
fighting
for
Iran
in
the
long
and
bitter
Iran-Iraq
war
--
until
the
Americans
``
brought
them
back
.
''
28 15
Sadr
opposes
federalism
because
a
Shia
regional
government
would
obey
his
enemies
,
Sistani
and
the
SCIRI
,
and
,
he
says
,
fall
under
Iranian
influence
.
50 13
To
underline
his
message
,
Sadr
sent
his
men
to
attack
the
Badr
militia
,
succeeding
in
Baghdad
,
where
the
Mahdis
are
numerous
,
but
failing
in
Najaf
,
where
Sadr
is
hated
after
the
destruction
caused
last
year
--
until
his
men
were
massacred
by
the
Americans
.
36 15
It
was
bad
enough
to
deal
with
Sadr
as
a
bandit
;
simple
political
arithmetic
now
dictates
that
he
will
likely
be
the
central
figure
deciding
the
outcome
of
October
's
vote
on
the
constitution
.
24 9
To
reject
the
constitution
and
force
new
elections
for
a
constitutional
assembly
,
opponents
need
a
two-thirds
majority
in
at
least
three
provinces
.
46 11
The
Sunnis
are
only
likely
to
win
in
two
provinces
,
but
if
Sadr
orders
his
followers
in
Baghdad
's
slums
to
vote
``
no
''
alongside
local
Sunnis
,
that
would
probably
flip
the
capital
to
the
constitution
's
opponents
,
ensuring
its
defeat
.
16 9
As
a
political
thug
,
Sadr
is
,
of
course
,
willing
to
be
bought
.
8 7
Last
year
he
was
wanted
for
murder
.
24 9
Now
he
wants
recognition
as
a
statesman
,
money
,
and
,
at
least
implicitly
,
Sistani
's
and
the
SCIRI
's
humiliation
.
13 7
He
might
receive
offers
,
and
perhaps
the
bargaining
has
already
started
.
27 11
But
some
of
the
Shias
whom
he
attacks
with
words
and
bullets
have
thousands
under
arms
,
and
think
that
he
should
be
offered
only
bullets
.

The
Secret
Policeman
's
Fall
As
Hungary
's
Prime
Minister
Ferenc
Gyurcsany
found
out
when
a
recorded
admission
that
his
government
was
lying
incited
riots
,
openness
in
government
does
n't
come
easily
in
Eastern
Europe
's
new
democracies
.
25 16
Like
Hungary
,
post-communist
Romania
has
struggled
to
increase
transparency
and
honesty
in
what
was
once
one
of
the
world
's
most
closed
societies
.
16 7
As
we
struggled
,
continued
secrecy
allowed
an
explosion
of
corruption
and
abuse
of
office
.
37 16
But
there
has
,
at
last
,
been
real
movement
towards
openness
--
progress
recognized
by
the
European
Union
when
it
gave
Romania
the
green
light
to
join
the
European
Union
at
the
beginning
of
2007
.
49 14
Aside
from
achieving
what
the
EU
now
deems
a
``
functioning
market
economy
,
''
key
political
and
legal
changes
,
which
I
have
overseen
as
Minister
of
Justice
,
range
from
increased
transparency
and
control
in
the
funding
of
political
parties
to
a
shakeup
of
the
judiciary
.
13 9
Judicial
reforms
are
,
in
turn
,
helping
to
root
out
corruption
.
39 13
Indictments
have
been
issued
against
former
and
current
cabinet
ministers
,
members
of
parliament
,
judges
,
prosecutors
,
lawyers
,
police
and
customs
officers
,
and
other
public
officials
,
as
well
as
directors
of
private
companies
.
38 15
In
addition
,
new
standardized
forms
have
been
introduced
for
declarations
of
assets
and
financial
interests
by
anyone
who
holds
an
official
position
in
government
,
parliament
,
public
and
local
administration
,
and
the
judicial
system
.
19 8
The
new
declarations
are
the
most
detailed
in
Europe
,
and
,
more
importantly
,
they
are
published
.
32 18
Romania
's
progress
is
confirmed
in
a
report
released
earlier
this
month
showing
that
citizens
'
access
to
government
information
in
Eastern
Europe
is
now
equal
to
that
in
established
democracies
.
58 13
Indeed
,
the
report
,
Transparency
and
Silence
,
conducted
by
the
Open
Society
Justice
Initiative
-LRB-
available
at
www.justiceinitiative.org
-RRB-
,
indicates
that
in
some
ways
the
new
democracies
have
something
to
teach
the
old
:
certain
government
agencies
in
Romania
were
more
responsive
to
citizen
requests
for
information
than
comparable
agencies
in
France
and
Spain
.
24 10
Specifically
,
60
%
of
the
requests
filed
in
Romania
met
,
compared
to
31
%
in
France
and
24
%
in
Spain
.
25 11
Other
countries
that
performed
well
include
Peru
and
Mexico
,
both
of
which
adopted
freedom
of
information
laws
in
2002
,
shortly
after
Romania
.
32 11
But
getting
access
to
sensitive
information
in
transitional
democracies
is
not
always
easier
,
as
I
know
from
my
previous
work
as
a
human
rights
lawyer
with
the
Romanian
Helsinki
Committee
.
22 12
Often
we
had
to
go
to
court
to
force
disclosure
of
information
,
using
Romania
's
2001
Freedom
of
Information
Act
.
30 16
For
example
,
even
when
we
won
a
case
regarding
access
to
the
records
of
wiretaps
authorized
by
the
general
prosecutor
,
the
prosecutor
simply
ignored
the
court
order
.
23 12
We
filed
a
civil
action
against
the
prosecutor
,
and
the
judge
imposed
a
fine
for
every
day
the
information
was
withheld
.
38 19
But
it
was
only
when
we
caught
the
media
's
attention
that
the
data
--
detailing
the
number
of
wiretaps
authorized
over
the
previous
10
years
,
against
whom
,
and
for
how
long
--
were
released
.
14 9
With
its
publication
,
Romania
began
to
move
away
from
its
Securitate-dominated
past
.
17 9
Now
,
inside
government
,
I
realize
that
sharing
information
with
the
public
is
sometimes
hard
.
12 7
But
when
painful
reforms
are
necessary
,
there
is
no
alternative
.
39 19
We
could
not
have
achieved
the
economic
and
political
reforms
that
qualified
us
for
EU
membership
if
we
had
not
subjected
policymaking
to
public
scrutiny
and
accepted
the
increased
public
participation
in
decision-making
that
inevitably
accompanies
such
openness
.
16 8
Indeed
,
this
has
become
a
sine
qua
non
of
democratic
government
throughout
the
world
.
23 9
When
the
United
States
adopted
its
Freedom
of
Information
Act
in
1966
,
it
joined
the
exclusive
company
of
Sweden
and
Finland
.
9 5
Today
,
roughly
65
countries
have
such
laws
.
19 11
In
Romania
,
those
who
fought
for
a
freedom
of
information
law
have
made
full
use
of
it
.
38 19
As
part
of
the
Justice
Initiative
study
,
those
who
request
information
from
Romania
's
government
were
willingly
supplied
with
the
kind
of
information
that
would
have
been
unthinkable
to
release
just
a
few
short
years
ago
.
43 14
The
Romanian
Defense
Ministry
,
for
example
,
disclosed
the
number
of
armed
forces
personnel
who
died
in
2003
,
as
well
as
the
causes
of
death
-LRB-
including
13
suicides
,
two
shootings
,
and
two
combat
deaths
in
Afghanistan
-RRB-
.
26 15
Likewise
,
the
Bucharest
court
was
asked
for
the
number
of
judges
disciplined
since
the
beginning
of
2000
,
including
grounds
for
any
sanctions
applied
.
34 14
The
Court
transferred
the
request
to
the
Superior
Council
of
Magistrates
,
which
provided
a
full
response
:
a
four-page
list
of
all
sanctioned
judges
,
with
details
of
the
reasons
and
penalties
.
13 8
Such
information
is
both
a
product
and
a
motor
of
continuing
reform
.
21 10
It
has
not
always
been
comfortable
for
those
in
government
,
and
there
is
still
a
tug-of-war
over
sensitive
documents
.
17 7
But
,
in
the
former
communist
bloc
,
the
benefits
brought
by
transparency
have
been
undeniable
.
41 12
At
the
same
time
,
Romania
's
experience
demonstrates
that
official
secrecy
remains
a
threat
to
the
core
values
of
democratic
governance
,
and
that
only
constant
vigilance
,
in
both
established
and
young
democracies
,
can
prevent
its
encroachment
.
21 14
Saving
the
Trees
of
Life
Nobody
can
get
through
the
day
without
using
a
product
that
comes
from
a
forest
.
44 11
To
a
greater
extent
than
most
people
realize
,
the
paper
we
write
on
,
the
water
that
comes
out
of
our
taps
,
the
medicine
that
heals
us
,
the
wood
that
builds
our
houses
and
furniture
,
all
originate
from
forests
.
13 9
Forests
provide
the
fresh
air
we
breathe
and
habitats
for
endangered
species
.
15 7
They
also
provide
us
with
recreational
opportunities
,
increasingly
important
in
our
complex
world
.
21 8
Approximately
1.5
billion
of
the
world
's
rural
poor
directly
depend
on
forests
for
basic
needs
like
food
and
fuel-wood
.
4 4
Yet
deforestation
continues
.
26 10
Every
year
,
we
lose
14.6
million
hectares
-LRB-
56,000
square
miles
-RRB-
of
forests
--
an
area
almost
four
times
the
area
of
Switzerland
.
32 12
Irresponsible
forest
management
,
enhanced
by
poor
governmental
regulation
and
enforcement
,
and
markets
that
reward
illegal
logging
,
are
conspiring
to
denude
the
world
's
most
valuable
and
threatened
forests
.
26 9
Once
forests
start
to
disappear
,
a
host
of
environmental
,
social
,
and
economic
ills
usually
follow
,
affecting
us
all
in
some
way
.
9 5
Indonesia
's
Sumatra
Island
is
a
good
example
.
23 16
Pulp
and
paper
companies
are
driving
rampant
and
illegal
destruction
of
forests
that
contain
the
richest
diversity
of
plants
in
the
world
.
33 13
It
is
likely
that
plants
not
yet
discovered
will
disappear
along
the
way
,
as
well
as
such
endangered
species
as
the
Sumatran
rhino
and
elephant
,
as
well
as
the
orangutan
.
29 12
When
Sumatra
's
forests
disappear
,
entire
communities
of
people
will
also
find
themselves
with
no
proper
place
to
live
and
no
decent
way
to
make
a
living
.
24 11
Moreover
,
the
distortion
to
global
markets
caused
by
trading
in
illegally
,
cheaply
produced
products
results
in
disadvantages
for
responsible
corporate
citizens
.
16 8
Developing
countries
are
losing
$
15
billion
in
tax
revenues
annually
due
to
illegal
logging
.
29 11
To
make
matters
worse
,
the
demand
for
wood
for
reconstruction
following
last
year
's
tsunami
is
intensifying
the
already
untenable
demands
being
placed
on
Sumatra
's
forests
.
13 7
Similar
threats
to
forests
are
evident
in
the
Amazon
and
Congo
Basin
.
36 13
The
recent
UN
Millennium
Ecosystem
Assessment
-LRB-
MEA
-RRB-
shows
that
forests
in
these
and
other
critical
regions
are
in
serious
decline
due
to
mismanagement
and
will
continue
to
disappear
unless
serious
measures
are
taken
.
53 12
Information
released
by
the
government
of
Brazil
indicates
that
deforestation
of
the
irreplaceable
forests
of
the
Amazon
,
due
to
factors
such
as
agricultural
conversion
,
reached
2.6
million
hectares
-LRB-
roughly
10,000
square
miles
-RRB-
in
the
past
year
,
bringing
the
total
deforested
area
of
the
Amazon
to
17
%
.
9 6
But
the
battle
against
deforestation
is
not
lost
.
26 11
Diverse
organizations
,
environmentalists
,
and
corporations
concerned
with
the
state
of
world
's
forests
are
joining
forces
to
reverse
deforestation
and
improve
forest
management
.
42 15
For
example
,
the
World
Wildlife
Fund
-LRB-
WWF
-RRB-
and
the
World
Bank
have
helped
Brazil
's
government
kick-start
an
initiative
that
established
over
17
million
hectares
-LRB-
69,000
square
miles
-RRB-
of
new
forest-protected
areas
such
as
national
parks
.
20 12
The
WWF/World
Bank
alliance
also
motivated
partners
to
establish
a
trust
fund
to
manage
these
protected
areas
in
perpetuity
.
24 8
Similarly
,
a
summit
among
the
leaders
of
the
Congo
Basin
countries
resulted
in
extraordinary
cross-border
cooperation
on
forest
conservation
and
responsible
management
.
22 8
This
in
turn
led
to
a
$
53
million
initiative
by
the
United
States
State
Department
to
promote
Congo
forest
conservation
.
30 9
Since
the
leaders
first
met
in
1999
,
3.5
million
hectares
-LRB-
more
than
13,000
square
miles
-RRB-
of
new
protected
areas
have
been
established
in
the
Congo
Basin
.
34 9
Nevertheless
,
given
the
effects
of
last
December
's
Asian
tsunami
,
the
weight
of
evidence
provided
by
the
MEA
,
and
deforestation
statistics
from
key
forest
regions
,
our
efforts
must
continue
.
45 19
The
World
Bank
and
WWF
recently
pledged
to
unite
in
an
effort
to
assist
in
reducing
the
rate
of
global
deforestation
by
10
%
by
2010
,
and
to
work
with
other
public
and
private
sector
institutions
to
pursue
ambitious
targets
on
forest
conservation
.
55 14
WWF
studies
show
that
if
the
world
's
forests
are
allotted
among
a
mix
of
uses
and
types
--
including
protected
areas
,
responsibly
managed
commercial
forests
,
and
restored
forest
landscapes
--
we
can
provide
the
world
's
needs
for
forest
products
while
conserving
important
environmental
and
social
values
for
the
foreseeable
future
.
18 9
Business
leaders
,
governments
,
and
civil
society
organizations
must
play
their
part
in
realizing
this
vision
.
5 4
Are
the
Saudis
Fanatics
?
33 11
Terrorist
attacks
in
Saudi
Arabia
have
led
many
to
question
not
only
the
ruling
House
of
Saud
's
prospects
for
survival
,
but
also
whether
the
kingdom
is
fundamentally
dysfunctional
and
destructive
.
23 11
Somehow
,
it
seems
,
Saudi
society
has
produced
a
stream
of
violent
fanaticism
that
draws
its
inspiration
from
extreme
religious
orthodoxy
.
37 12
The
fact
that
15
of
the
19
hijackers
in
the
September
11
,
2001
,
attacks
on
the
United
States
were
Saudis
crystallized
a
long-held
view
of
the
kingdom
as
a
bastion
of
authoritarianism
and
intolerance
.
21 9
In
some
respects
,
this
perception
is
accurate
,
but
it
can
not
be
applied
to
the
broad
Saudi
public
.
22 15
On
the
contrary
,
it
would
be
a
grave
mistake
to
assume
that
fanatical
Islamism
fully
defines
Saudi
attitudes
toward
religion
.
29 13
Between
2001
and
2003
,
I
was
part
of
a
team
that
undertook
an
extensive
survey
of
values
in
Saudi
Arabia
,
Egypt
,
Iran
,
and
Jordan
.
11 7
Our
results
provide
a
surprisingly
nuanced
picture
of
Saudi
attitudes
.
30 9
Compared
to
respondents
in
the
other
Middle
Eastern
countries
,
Saudis
were
less
religious
overall
,
and
their
attitudes
toward
democracy
and
arranged
marriage
also
indicate
a
moderate
undercurrent
.
39 13
To
be
sure
,
in
all
four
countries
,
religiosity
is
widespread
,
with
more
than
90
%
of
respondents
collectively
reporting
that
they
believe
in
God
,
in
life
after
death
,
and
in
heaven
and
hell
.
13 10
But
the
Saudis
appear
to
be
less
religious
than
their
fellow
Muslims
.
27 10
Sixty-two
percent
of
Saudis
described
themselves
as
religious
,
compared
with
82
%
of
Iranians
,
85
%
of
Jordanians
,
and
98
%
of
Egyptians
.
19 12
Americans
also
appear
to
be
far
more
religious
than
Saudis
,
with
81
%
describing
themselves
that
way
.
18 16
Some
of
this
variation
may
be
explained
by
cross-national
differences
regarding
what
it
means
to
be
religious
.
27 15
For
example
,
Americans
may
define
religiosity
differently
than
Middle
Easterners
,
with
perhaps
a
weaker
attachment
to
religious
beliefs
than
is
true
in
Islamic
countries
.
13 11
This
might
also
account
in
part
for
the
differences
between
Muslim
countries
.
46 13
But
the
gap
in
self-defined
religiosity
between
Saudis
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
Iranians
,
Jordanians
,
and
Egyptians
,
on
the
other
,
is
so
great
that
it
challenges
the
prevalent
perception
of
Saudi
Arabia
as
a
highly
conservative
and
religious
society
.
45 14
Indeed
,
actions
speak
louder
than
words
:
only
28
%
of
Saudis
said
that
they
participate
in
weekly
religious
services
,
compared
to
27
%
of
Iranians
,
44
%
of
Jordanians
,
42
%
of
Egyptians
,
and
45
%
of
Americans
.
20 10
These
findings
,
while
running
contrary
to
popular
perceptions
of
Saudi
culture
,
are
less
startling
than
they
appear
.
32 10
Sociologists
of
religion
have
long
argued
that
in
a
monolithic
religious
environment
,
or
when
religious
institutions
are
closely
tied
to
the
state
,
the
overall
religiosity
of
the
public
declines
.
28 17
It
makes
sense
to
think
that
when
state
authorities
enforce
strict
codes
of
behavior
,
people
tend
to
rebel
and
move
away
from
officially
sanctioned
religious
institutions
.
44 19
Little
wonder
,
then
,
that
Egyptians
and
Jordanians
,
who
live
in
countries
where
the
state
does
not
enforce
piety
,
are
more
religious
than
Iranians
or
Saudis
,
who
must
cope
with
local
``
virtue
''
police
backed
by
the
state
.
11 6
Even
on
marriage
,
many
Saudis
expressed
surprisingly
liberal
views
.
37 15
Respondents
were
nearly
evenly
split
on
the
question
of
arranged
marriages
,
with
half
supporting
the
idea
that
marriage
should
be
based
on
parental
consent
,
while
48
%
preferred
love
as
the
basis
of
matrimony
.
29 15
Given
entrenched
gender
segregation
and
paternal
dominance
,
this
finding
appears
to
reveal
a
strong
desire
for
greater
individual
choice
in
what
has
traditionally
been
a
family-driven
decision
.
23 12
Finally
,
the
Saudis
turn
out
to
be
strong
supporters
of
democracy
,
once
again
contradicting
a
popular
image
of
Saudi
conservatism
.
28 10
Of
the
Saudis
polled
,
58
%
considered
democracy
the
best
form
of
government
,
23
%
disagreed
,
and
18
%
did
not
express
an
opinion
.
17 11
Majority
support
for
democracy
in
a
country
with
no
prior
secular
and
nationalist
history
seems
counter-intuitive
.
21 9
In
fact
,
support
for
democracy
corresponds
with
a
number
of
other
liberal
attitudes
that
we
found
in
Saudi
Arabia
.
31 11
Supporters
of
democracy
tend
to
be
less
religious
,
more
secular
,
more
tolerant
of
others
,
more
critical
of
public-sector
performance
,
and
more
concerned
with
Western
cultural
invasion
.
27 15
Beyond
the
survey
data
,
history
has
shown
that
liberal
ideas
become
more
popular
when
a
despotic
monarch
governs
people
in
alliance
with
a
religious
establishment
.
24 10
A
strong
current
of
liberalism
appeared
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
in
Ottoman
Syria
in
response
to
the
religious
despotism
of
Sultan
Abdulhamid
.
33 9
At
the
same
time
,
an
anti-clerical
,
secular
movement
on
behalf
of
constitutionalism
appeared
in
Iran
-
a
reaction
to
the
absolutist
alliance
between
the
Quajar
Shahs
and
the
religious
establishment
.
27 10
In
view
of
the
similarities
between
those
historical
precedents
and
current
conditions
in
Saudi
Arabia
,
we
ought
not
to
rule
out
the
possibility
of
reform
.
23 13
Now
survey
data
,
too
,
suggest
that
Saudis
may
well
begin
demanding
a
more
transparent
politics
and
a
less
interventionist
religion
.
29 11
The
European
Museum
In
the
late
nineteenth
century
,
Europe
viewed
Asia
mainly
as
either
a
source
of
inspiration
for
its
artists
or
a
focus
of
imperial
ambition
.
30 10
Asians
,
for
their
part
,
viewed
Europe
as
either
a
model
of
modernity
,
as
in
Meiji
Japan
,
or
a
barometer
of
decay
,
as
in
China
.
33 10
A
century
later
,
the
Japanese
economic
miracle
had
transformed
the
image
of
at
least
a
small
part
of
Asia
in
European
eyes
into
a
place
of
rapid
technological
and
industrial
progress
.
46 16
Now
,
in
the
first
years
of
the
twenty-first
century
,
the
perception
of
Europe
in
Asia
and
of
Asia
in
Europe
is
changing
dramatically
,
as
Asia
's
economies
boom
while
the
European
Union
finds
itself
mired
in
a
crisis
of
identity
and
confidence
.
40 14
Prominent
Asians
,
such
as
former
Singaporean
leader
Lee
Kuan
Yew
,
are
now
warning
Europeans
that
if
they
continue
on
their
current
course
,
Europe
will
rapidly
become
irrelevant
for
anything
other
than
tourism
and
high-end
real
estate
.
17 10
A
prominent
Chinese
businessman
who
divides
his
time
between
Hong-Kong
and
London
was
even
more
specific
.
63 11
At
a
private
gathering
of
top
business
and
political
leaders
in
Paris
a
few
weeks
ago
,
he
said
,
``
You
Europeans
are
becoming
a
Third
World
country
,
you
spend
time
on
the
wrong
subjects
--
the
constitution
,
the
welfare
state
,
the
pensions
crisis
--
and
you
systematically
give
the
wrong
answers
to
the
questions
you
raise
.
''
32 9
Europeans
'
views
of
Asia
in
general
,
and
China
in
particular
,
are
more
complex
and
swing
from
lucid
adjustment
to
a
new
and
respected
competitor
to
pure
ideological
rejection
.
47 12
In
May
1968
,
in
France
,
the
students
--
or
some
of
them
,
at
least
--
who
took
to
the
streets
to
invent
a
new
world
were
dreaming
of
Maoist
China
,
a
China
in
the
midst
of
the
brutal
and
senseless
Cultural
Revolution
.
33 16
Their
absurd
and
baroque
infatuation
was
as
much
the
product
of
ignorance
of
Mao
's
crimes
as
it
was
the
result
of
boredom
in
a
prosperous
society
where
unemployment
was
virtually
nonexistent
.
15 6
Today
,
by
contrast
,
their
heirs
are
openly
criticizing
the
Asian
capitalist
model
.
34 12
Yesterday
China
was
an
anti-capitalist
lodestar
for
utopian
revolutionaries
;
today
it
has
become
an
ultra-liberal
nemesis
for
a
new
generation
of
utopian
reactionaries
--
the
defenders
of
the
status
quo
in
Europe
.
33 11
The
student
demonstrators
in
the
streets
of
Paris
recently
do
n't
want
to
become
like
Chinese
and
Indians
;
they
reject
the
logic
of
globalization
and
refuse
to
surrender
hard-won
social
guarantees
.
10 5
European
economic
elites
perceive
China
and
India
very
differently
.
28 13
They
are
now
fully
aware
that
their
slightly
nostalgic
post-colonial
view
of
these
countries
as
large
export
markets
and
deep
reservoirs
of
cheap
labor
has
become
outdated
.
16 11
China
and
India
have
become
genuine
competitors
who
deserve
respect
,
if
not
sheer
awe
.
20 9
Quality
,
costs
,
and
delivery
times
in
auto
manufacturing
,
for
example
,
are
reaching
the
European
level
.
45 10
Europe
retains
an
advantage
in
terms
of
pure
science
,
as
in
the
pharmaceutical
industry
,
but
emerging
world-class
companies
,
particularly
in
India
,
are
increasingly
able
to
recruit
M.I.T.
and
Harvard
graduates
,
while
maintaining
lower
labor
costs
and
thus
global
competitiveness
.
38 15
Unfortunately
,
although
European
leaders
recognize
the
Asian
challenge
,
they
have
failed
to
use
it
as
a
reality
test
in
the
irresistible
process
of
globalization
and
as
a
call
to
arms
in
social
and
economic
terms
.
40 19
In
fact
,
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
European
politicians
,
with
few
exceptions
,
such
as
Tony
Blair
,
have
been
slow
to
adjust
their
worldviews
in
accordance
with
the
revolutionary
pace
of
change
in
Asia
.
46 16
Caught
between
their
lack
of
long-term
strategic
vision
and
their
obsession
with
short-term
interests
,
Europe
's
political
leaders
have
largely
failed
to
win
the
respect
of
their
Asian
counterparts
,
in
contrast
to
European
companies
,
which
are
faring
much
better
in
Asian
eyes
.
41 15
Of
course
,
on
a
continent
that
has
largely
failed
to
bury
its
past
and
close
the
door
to
nationalist
ghosts
,
the
EU
is
also
often
regarded
by
Asians
as
a
model
of
reconciliation
,
peace
,
and
prosperity
.
14 9
But
if
Europe
's
performance
continues
to
decline
,
would
this
perception
survive
?
34 17
Perhaps
Asians
would
then
come
to
regard
the
European
model
as
a
political
version
of
Venice
--
a
place
to
visit
with
nostalgia
for
its
past
glory
and
admiration
for
its
museum-like
quality
.
30 11
The
Red
and
the
Blue
Condoleeza
Rice
's
replacement
of
Colin
Powell
as
US
Secretary
of
State
shows
that
America
's
recent
presidential
election
continues
to
produce
powerful
reverberations
.
21 9
But
understanding
what
that
election
tells
us
about
America
is
important
not
only
for
Americans
,
but
for
the
world
.
21 10
This
year
's
presidential
vote
proves
that
America
's
democracy
is
healthy
,
but
that
some
things
could
be
better
.
33 9
Contrary
to
the
election
in
2000
,
when
President
Bush
lost
the
popular
vote
and
barely
won
the
vote
in
the
Electoral
College
,
Bush
prevailed
this
time
by
3.5
million
votes
.
19 11
While
some
Democrats
remain
bitter
,
there
is
little
serious
questioning
of
the
legitimacy
of
Bush
's
victory
.
17 9
America
remains
closely
divided
into
red
states
-LRB-
Republican
-RRB-
and
blue
states
-LRB-
Democrat
-RRB-
.
28 12
If
100,000
votes
changed
in
the
red
state
of
Ohio
,
John
Kerry
would
be
the
president
-LRB-
albeit
with
a
minority
of
the
popular
vote
-RRB-
.
42 14
The
Electoral
College
was
included
in
America
's
constitution
to
protect
small
states
in
a
federal
system
,
but
it
now
means
that
the
political
campaign
focuses
largely
on
the
dozen
or
so
battleground
states
where
public
opinion
is
closely
divided
.
15 11
More
fundamentally
,
there
is
something
unseemly
about
electing
presidents
without
a
popular
majority
.
18 15
So
it
is
time
for
a
serious
debate
about
amending
the
constitution
to
abolish
the
Electoral
College
.
16 11
Some
observers
also
complain
about
the
divisive
negative
rhetoric
and
advertising
that
characterized
the
campaign
.
9 8
But
this
should
be
seen
in
historical
perspective
.
25 10
In
the
era
of
the
Founding
Fathers
,
newspapers
were
extremely
partisan
,
and
George
Washington
was
dismayed
by
the
harshness
of
political
language
.
42 13
For
much
of
its
early
history
--
to
say
nothing
of
the
era
of
the
Civil
War
and
Reconstruction
--
the
country
was
as
closely
divided
as
it
is
today
,
and
bitter
campaign
rhetoric
reflected
the
closeness
of
the
competition
.
29 7
At
the
same
time
,
despite
negative
advertising
by
both
sides
,
the
three
nationally
televised
debates
raised
important
issues
in
a
serious
format
and
were
widely
viewed
.
16 9
In
general
,
an
incumbent
president
with
a
growing
economy
is
likely
to
be
re-elected
.
18 9
In
that
sense
,
what
was
surprising
about
Bush
's
re-election
was
how
thin
his
majority
was
.
15 8
In
large
part
,
this
was
because
of
the
unpopularity
of
the
Iraq
War
.
47 12
Kerry
tried
to
make
the
war
,
the
low
rate
of
job
creation
,
inadequate
healthcare
,
and
Bush
's
tax
cuts
for
upper
income
groups
the
central
issues
of
the
campaign
,
but
some
observers
felt
that
this
never
added
up
to
a
clear
message
.
21 10
Bush
countered
with
concerns
about
security
against
terrorism
and
cultural
populism
on
issues
such
as
gay
marriage
and
abortion
rights
.
12 5
In
the
end
,
security
and
cultural
populism
trumped
economic
populism
.
28 17
Interpretation
of
the
election
has
been
influenced
by
exit
polls
in
which
voters
were
asked
-LRB-
after
they
voted
-RRB-
about
which
issues
mattered
most
to
them
.
28 17
The
largest
number
-LRB-
22
%
-RRB-
answered
``
moral
values
,
''
comparison
to
20
%
who
cited
the
economy
and
19
%
who
mentioned
terrorism
.
24 13
Social
conservatives
interpreted
this
to
mean
that
they
won
the
election
for
Bush
,
and
that
their
agenda
should
dominate
his
next
term
.
31 16
But
a
Pew
poll
taken
a
week
after
the
election
indicated
that
the
category
``
moral
values
''
encompassed
a
wide
range
of
issues
besides
abortion
rights
and
gay
marriage
.
32 15
In
fact
,
polls
show
that
25
%
of
the
public
support
gay
marriage
and
35
%
favor
legal
civil
unions
for
gay
couples
-LRB-
the
position
advocated
by
Kerry
-RRB-
.
31 12
Nonetheless
,
for
the
37
%
who
oppose
gay
marriage
,
particularly
in
the
red
center
of
the
country
,
the
issue
helped
mobilize
Bush
supporters
to
come
to
vote
.
11 8
A
larger
question
is
whether
the
US
is
hopelessly
divided
.
30 12
The
election
map
of
red
and
blue
states
has
given
rise
to
Internet
jokes
and
cartoons
about
the
two
blue
coasts
seceding
from
the
red
center
of
the
country
.
7 6
Some
call
it
``
Coastopia
.
''
8 5
But
the
division
is
not
that
sharp
.
34 12
Many
states
in
both
camps
were
won
by
narrow
margins
,
and
if
one
colors
the
map
at
the
level
of
counties
rather
than
states
,
much
of
the
country
looks
quite
purple
.
15 9
Cities
versus
suburbs
and
rural
areas
is
a
better
description
than
coasts
versus
heartland
.
26 13
Indeed
,
public
opinion
polls
show
that
most
Americans
are
clustered
in
the
moderate
center
of
the
political
spectrum
rather
than
at
the
two
extremes
.
22 10
But
political
elites
,
such
as
party
activists
and
members
of
Congress
,
tend
to
be
more
extreme
than
the
public
.
20 14
At
first
,
this
seems
puzzling
,
because
they
should
have
an
incentive
to
move
to
the
vote-rich
middle
.
38 15
But
many
members
of
Congress
represent
districts
that
are
safe
for
their
parties
,
and
the
threat
to
their
re-election
comes
in
party
primaries
that
are
dominated
by
the
more
activist
and
extreme
wings
of
the
parties
.
37 17
This
tendency
is
reinforced
by
the
rise
of
cable
television
,
which
attracts
viewers
by
means
of
contentious
``
infotainment
''
programs
,
and
Internet
bloggers
,
who
engage
in
fierce
polemics
with
no
editorial
filter
.
35 15
Reforms
to
alter
the
boundaries
of
Congressional
districts
to
make
them
more
competitive
would
help
alleviate
this
problem
,
but
few
incumbent
Congressmen
will
vote
for
changes
that
might
increase
their
risk
of
defeat
.
20 13
The
closeness
of
the
result
suggests
Bush
won
less
of
a
mandate
for
change
than
he
seems
to
believe
.
44 13
Faced
with
difficult
questions
in
foreign
,
fiscal
,
and
social
policy
,
he
would
be
wise
to
turn
toward
the
center
rather
than
conciliate
his
conservative
base
,
but
it
remains
unclear
whether
the
politics
of
conviction
or
of
pragmatism
will
prevail
.
30 9
Kicking
the
Oil
Habit
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
has
made
addressing
climate
change
a
high
priority
on
Germany
's
agenda
for
its
EU
and
G-8
presidencies
that
begin
in
January
.
53 19
Here
is
a
concrete
proposal
,
one
general
enough
for
world
leaders
to
consider
and
accept
,
and
clear
enough
for
other
governments
and
businesses
to
grasp
:
simply
set
a
date
,
at
the
next
G-8
summit
,
by
which
oil-powered
cars
would
no
longer
be
licensed
in
major
industrialized
countries
.
13 8
Such
a
decision
would
have
a
strongly
positive
economic
and
geopolitical
impact
.
52 12
The
real
cause
of
today
's
worries
over
energy
is
not
the
decline
in
world
oil
reserves
,
but
rather
that
domestic
oil
production
by
the
top
consumers
--
Europe
,
the
United
States
,
and
China
--
will
decline
at
the
very
moment
that
growing
Asian
demand
strains
the
market
.
22 12
Available
reserves
will
increasingly
be
concentrated
in
the
Middle
East
simply
because
supplies
in
all
other
regions
will
be
depleted
sooner
.
17 10
Moreover
,
the
main
oil
exporters
are
unwilling
to
subordinate
their
investment
policies
to
market
requirements
.
22 13
Saudi
Arabia
seeks
to
run
its
oil
production
independently
,
while
Iran
scares
off
potential
investors
with
bureaucratic
hurdles
and
corruption
.
19 9
Iraq
suffers
from
a
lack
of
security
,
and
foreign
investors
in
Russia
are
thwarted
at
every
turn
.
21 13
Those
four
states
contain
half
of
the
world
's
proven
oil
reserves
and
two-thirds
of
what
could
potentially
be
exported
.
27 11
All
this
,
not
production
costs
,
lies
at
the
heart
of
high
oil
prices
and
the
scramble
for
oil
contracts
in
Central
Asia
and
Africa
.
21 14
To
believe
that
high
oil
prices
are
good
because
they
serve
the
environment
ignores
some
basic
facts
of
international
politics
.
46 17
First
,
in
many
of
the
poorest
African
and
Asian
countries
,
oil
imports
account
for
a
significantly
higher
share
of
national
expenditure
than
in
industrialized
countries
,
which
means
that
economic
growth
and
social
development
are
being
imperiled
,
while
new
debt
crises
loom
.
12 7
Rents
from
oil
production
impede
reforms
in
the
major
exporting
countries
.
21 8
Thanks
to
their
lubricated
financial
strength
,
regimes
like
those
in
Venezuela
and
Iran
increasingly
feel
unconstrained
by
international
rules
.
39 15
Latecomers
among
consuming
nations
,
such
as
China
,
mimic
the
former
habits
of
the
industrialized
West
,
with
their
long
record
of
overlooking
human
rights
abuses
in
order
to
secure
lucrative
deals
with
authoritarian
,
oil-rich
regimes
.
31 12
Only
the
world
's
political
and
economic
heavyweights
,
the
main
industrialized
countries
that
remain
by
far
the
biggest
consumers
of
hydrocarbons
,
can
initiate
change
on
a
global
scale
.
30 20
Change
must
begin
in
the
transport
sector
,
which
accounts
for
more
than
half
of
current
oil
consumption
--
a
share
that
is
likely
to
rise
in
the
future
.
19 11
The
G-8
countries
should
therefore
agree
to
no
longer
license
any
new
,
oil-powered
cars
from
2025
onwards
.
28 19
This
decision
would
not
be
directed
against
individual
mobility
,
but
against
the
dissipation
of
a
scarce
resource
that
is
more
urgently
needed
to
produce
synthetic
materials
.
9 6
Political
leaders
should
not
privilege
any
particular
technology
.
33 15
Instead
,
they
should
provide
the
automobile
industry
with
incentives
to
develop
alternative
technologies
that
rely
on
bio-mass
fuel
,
ethylene
,
hydrogen
,
and
even
natural
gas
during
a
transition
period
.
28 9
Countries
that
lead
the
way
politically
will
,
as
a
collateral
benefit
,
provide
domestic
industries
with
a
leading
position
in
energy
technology
,
ensuring
future
markets
.
20 13
The
expected
significant
reduction
of
CO2-emissions
could
eventually
bring
about
the
breakthrough
that
is
needed
in
international
climate
policies
.
44 10
But
economic
development
comes
into
play
as
well
:
curing
our
``
addiction
''
to
oil
would
leave
more
of
it
to
poorer
,
less
developed
,
and
newly
industrializing
countries
,
as
well
as
pushing
down
prices
and
easing
geopolitical
energy
competition
.
24 12
Geopolitically
,
the
benefits
would
similarly
obvious
,
as
the
ability
of
major
oil
exporters
to
blackmail
industrialized
countries
would
be
significantly
reduced
.
43 15
This
could
increase
the
bargaining
power
of
the
international
community
in
the
Middle
East
,
and
might
strengthen
those
social
forces
in
countries
like
Saudi
Arabia
,
Iran
,
and
Russia
that
seriously
wish
to
promote
political
and
economic
reform
from
within
.
20 10
As
a
technologically
advanced
and
major
automobile-producing
country
,
Germany
is
well
placed
to
bring
about
such
an
initiative
.
51 14
Merkel
,
who
holds
a
doctorate
in
physics
and
started
her
political
career
as
an
environment
minister
--
presiding
in
1995
over
the
first
conference
of
the
UN
Framework
Convention
on
Climate
Change
--
may
have
more
credibility
in
addressing
the
issue
than
any
of
her
EU
and
G-8
colleagues
.
11 9
Now
is
the
time
for
a
bold
act
of
leadership
.
11 6
The
Trade-and-Aid
Myth
Trade
and
aid
have
become
international
buzzwords
.
32 11
More
aid
-LRB-
including
debt
relief
-RRB-
and
greater
access
to
rich
countries
'
markets
for
poor
countries
'
products
now
appears
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
global
agenda
.
22 10
Indeed
,
the
debate
nowadays
is
not
about
what
to
do
,
but
how
much
to
do
,
and
how
fast
.
17 7
Lost
in
all
this
are
the
clear
lessons
of
the
last
five
decades
of
economic
development
.
17 12
Foremost
among
these
is
that
economic
development
is
largely
in
the
hands
of
poor
nations
themselves
.
17 10
Countries
that
have
done
well
in
the
recent
past
have
done
so
through
their
own
efforts
.
11 6
Aid
and
market
access
have
rarely
played
a
critical
role
.
28 18
Consider
a
developing
country
that
has
free
and
preferential
market
access
to
its
largest
neighbor
,
which
also
happens
to
be
the
world
's
most
powerful
economy
.
39 20
Suppose
,
in
addition
,
that
this
country
is
able
to
send
millions
of
its
citizens
to
work
across
the
border
,
receives
a
huge
volume
of
inward
investment
,
and
is
totally
integrated
into
international
production
chains
.
25 12
Moreover
,
the
country
's
banking
system
is
supported
by
its
rich
neighbor
's
demonstrated
willingness
to
act
as
a
lender
of
last
resort
.
11 6
Globalization
does
not
get
much
better
than
this
,
right
?
6 5
Now
consider
a
second
country
.
49 12
This
one
faces
a
trade
embargo
in
the
world
's
largest
market
,
receives
neither
foreign
aid
nor
any
other
kind
of
assistance
from
the
West
,
is
excluded
from
international
organizations
like
the
WTO
,
and
is
prevented
from
borrowing
from
the
IMF
and
the
World
Bank
.
36 12
If
these
external
disadvantages
are
not
debilitating
enough
,
this
economy
also
maintains
its
own
high
barriers
on
international
trade
-LRB-
in
the
form
of
state
trading
,
import
tariffs
,
and
quantitative
restrictions
-RRB-
.
16 8
As
the
reader
may
have
guessed
,
these
are
real
countries
:
Mexico
and
Vietnam
.
45 17
Mexico
shares
a
2,000-mile
long
border
with
the
United
States
,
which
provides
not
only
privileged
market
access
in
goods
and
labor
,
but
also
a
claim
to
the
resources
of
the
US
Treasury
-LRB-
as
became
apparent
during
the
1995
peso
crisis
-RRB-
.
35 10
By
contrast
,
America
maintained
a
trade
embargo
against
Vietnam
until
1994
,
established
diplomatic
relations
only
in
1995
,
and
did
not
provide
most-favored
nation
treatment
to
Vietnamese
imports
for
years
after
that
.
7 6
Vietnam
still
remains
outside
the
WTO
.
6 5
Now
consider
their
economic
performance
.
28 12
Since
NAFTA
was
signed
in
December
1992
,
Mexico
's
economy
has
grown
at
an
average
annual
rate
of
barely
over
1
%
in
per
capita
terms
.
46 16
This
is
not
only
far
below
the
rates
of
Asia
's
economic
superstars
;
it
is
also
a
fraction
of
Mexico
's
own
growth
performance
during
the
decades
that
preceded
the
debt
crisis
of
1982
-LRB-
3.6
%
per
year
between
1960
and
1981
-RRB-
.
49 16
Vietnam
,
however
,
grew
at
an
annual
rate
of
5.6
%
per
capita
between
the
onset
of
its
economic
reforms
in
1988
and
the
establishment
of
diplomatic
relations
with
the
US
in
1995
,
and
has
continued
to
grow
at
a
rapid
4.5
%
pace
since
then
.
15 8
Vietnam
witnessed
a
dramatic
fall
in
poverty
,
while
in
Mexico
real
wages
fell
.
33 13
Both
countries
experienced
sharp
increases
in
international
trade
and
foreign
investment
,
but
the
pictures
are
utterly
different
where
it
counts
most
:
rising
standards
of
living
,
particularly
for
the
poor
.
19 13
What
these
examples
show
is
that
domestic
efforts
trump
everything
else
in
determining
a
country
's
economic
fortunes
.
58 18
All
the
opportunities
that
the
US
market
presented
to
Mexico
could
not
offset
the
consequences
of
policy
mistakes
at
home
,
especially
the
failure
to
reverse
the
real
appreciation
of
the
peso
's
exchange
rate
and
the
inability
to
extend
the
productivity
gains
achieved
in
a
narrow
range
of
export
activities
to
the
rest
of
the
economy
.
13 8
What
matters
most
is
whether
a
country
adopts
the
right
growth
strategy
.
26 15
With
none
of
Mexico
's
advantages
,
Vietnam
pursued
a
strategy
that
focused
on
diversifying
its
economy
and
enhancing
the
productive
capacity
of
domestic
suppliers
.
14 11
Broader
post-war
experience
supports
the
conclusion
that
domestic
policies
are
what
matter
most
.
26 13
South
Korea
took
off
in
the
early
1960
's
not
when
foreign
aid
was
at
its
apex
,
but
when
it
was
being
phased
out
.
11 7
Taiwan
did
not
receive
foreign
aid
or
preferential
market
access
.
19 7
China
and
India
,
today
's
two
economic
superstars
,
have
prospered
largely
through
sui
generis
reform
efforts
.
36 14
It
is
tempting
to
ascribe
the
rare
African
successes
--
Botswana
and
Mauritius
--
to
foreign
demand
for
their
exports
-LRB-
diamonds
and
garments
,
respectively
-RRB-
,
but
that
story
goes
only
so
far
.
14 9
Obviously
,
both
countries
would
be
considerably
poorer
without
access
to
foreign
markets
.
29 15
But
,
as
in
other
cases
of
successful
development
,
what
distinguishes
them
is
not
the
external
advantages
they
possess
,
but
their
ability
to
exploit
these
advantages
.
12 9
Witness
the
mess
that
other
countries
made
of
their
natural-resource
endowments
.
16 7
The
word
``
diamond
''
hardly
conjures
images
of
peace
and
prosperity
in
Sierra
Leone
.
20 11
Similarly
,
few
of
the
export
processing
zones
proliferating
around
the
world
have
delivered
the
results
observed
in
Mauritius
.
12 10
None
of
this
absolves
rich
countries
of
their
responsibility
to
help
.
31 12
They
can
make
the
world
less
hospitable
for
corrupt
dictators
--
for
example
,
by
greater
sharing
of
financial
information
and
by
not
recognizing
the
international
contracts
that
they
sign
.
39 15
Similarly
,
increasing
the
number
of
poor-country
workers
allowed
to
work
in
rich
countries
,
and
providing
greater
scope
for
growth-oriented
policies
by
relaxing
WTO
rules
and
conditionality
from
the
US
,
would
produce
greater
long-term
development
impact
.
25 12
It
is
far
from
clear
that
expanding
market
access
and
boosting
aid
are
the
most
productive
use
of
valuable
political
capital
in
the
North
.
19 11
Development
should
focus
not
on
trade
and
aid
,
but
on
improving
the
policy
environment
in
poor
countries
.
5 5
Who
's
Dependent
Now
?
25 10
If
the
late
great
Argentine
economist
Raul
Prebisch
were
alive
today
,
he
no
doubt
would
wonder
whether
the
world
had
turned
upside
down
.
32 14
His
hugely
influential
``
dependency
''
theory
argued
that
if
poor
countries
relied
too
much
on
commodity
exports
,
they
would
never
achieve
the
industrial
depth
needed
to
sustain
rapid
growth
.
19 12
Instead
,
they
would
become
mired
in
a
cycle
of
declining
global
commodity
prices
and
ever-dwindling
income
shares
.
22 10
Prebisch
's
preferred
policy
response
,
protectionism
,
proved
disastrous
for
the
many
Latin
American
and
African
countries
that
heeded
him
.
23 13
But
the
fact
is
that
for
many
years
,
Prebisch
seemed
to
have
made
the
right
call
on
long-term
commodity
price
trends
.
23 8
Relentless
efficiency
gains
in
agriculture
and
resource
extraction
pushed
down
prices
for
commodities
,
especially
during
the
1980
's
and
1990
's
.
21 9
With
few
exceptions
,
countries
that
focused
on
commodity
exports
performed
dismally
,
whereas
many
resource-poor
Asian
countries
raced
ahead
.
34 7
Today
,
however
,
with
Asia
's
giants
,
India
and
China
,
joining
the
global
economy
,
prices
for
oil
,
gold
,
wheat
,
and
virtually
every
other
commodity
are
exploding
.
38 12
While
there
will
always
be
cycles
--
oil
prices
,
for
example
,
will
probably
fall
before
they
start
rising
again
--
the
long-run
trend
for
many
commodities
will
clearly
remain
upward
for
some
time
to
come
.
40 12
What
many
trade
negotiators
and
other
policymakers
do
not
seem
to
have
recognized
yet
,
though
Prebisch
would
have
realized
it
instantly
,
is
that
this
dramatic
turn
of
events
carries
huge
implications
for
the
global
balance
of
power
.
21 9
Indeed
,
perhaps
no
other
aspect
of
economic
globalization
will
pose
greater
challenges
to
world
leaders
over
the
coming
decades
.
5 5
The
questions
are
many
.
31 17
Are
today
's
rich
countries
prepared
for
an
era
of
co-dependency
,
in
which
they
are
just
as
desperate
for
commodities
as
developing
countries
are
for
industrial
imports
and
technology
?
20 8
Are
they
prepared
for
the
inevitable
flow
of
power
and
influence
to
commodity
producers
as
they
become
much
wealthier
?
40 14
How
will
the
world
's
two
superpowers
,
China
and
the
United
States
,
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
important
commodity-exporting
regions
from
Africa
to
the
Middle
East
to
Central
Asia
are
littered
with
ill-formed
nation
states
?
27 10
Some
self-anointed
seers
portray
the
problem
as
being
one
of
finite
natural
resources
,
with
the
world
running
out
of
critical
commodities
at
an
alarming
rate
.
45 18
Nowadays
,
there
are
many
adherents
of
the
``
Hubbert
's
peak
''
theory
of
oil
production
,
which
holds
that
we
have
reached
the
upper
limits
of
output
capacity
,
the
wells
are
running
dry
,
and
it
is
all
downhill
from
here
.
30 12
However
,
as
leading
oil
historian
Dan
Yergin
points
out
,
prophets
of
doom
have
declared
that
the
world
is
running
out
of
oil
at
least
four
times
already
.
12 6
Each
time
,
radical
improvements
in
technology
made
the
threat
evaporate
.
14 8
In
the
late
1800
's
,
oil
extraction
involved
dredging
with
a
mule
.
15 10
Today
,
no
one
thinks
anything
of
drilling
3,000
meters
beneath
the
ocean
floor
.
14 8
There
have
been
similar
improvements
across
the
board
in
metals
mining
and
agriculture
.
13 10
No
,
the
world
is
not
about
to
run
out
of
commodities
.
49 19
Instead
,
what
is
happening
is
that
the
integration
of
2.5
billion
people
-LRB-
China
and
India
alone
-RRB-
into
the
global
economy
is
producing
a
demand
shift
that
is
likely
to
put
far
more
upward
pressure
on
commodity
prices
than
any
technology
gains
are
likely
to
offset
.
35 12
So
,
for
at
least
the
next
50
to
75
years
,
and
perhaps
until
humans
start
mining
on
Mars
sometime
in
the
coming
centuries
,
prices
for
many
natural
resources
are
headed
up
.
15 10
Will
the
rebalancing
of
global
economic
power
that
results
from
this
destabilize
world
politics
?
34 13
World
War
I
,
of
course
,
was
partly
set
off
by
Germany
's
concern
that
the
other
colonial
powers
had
locked
up
too
large
a
share
of
world
oil
and
commodity
supplies
.
23 11
Similarly
,
in
World
War
II
,
Japan
feared
for
the
stability
of
its
foreign
supplies
of
oil
and
other
natural
resources
.
20 12
Will
similar
tensions
arise
between
resource-challenged
China
-LRB-
where
even
water
scarcity
is
a
problem
-RRB-
and
the
West
?
26 10
Fortunately
,
this
does
not
seem
likely
for
the
moment
,
especially
given
the
Chinese
leadership
's
sober
and
pragmatic
approach
to
its
resource
problems
.
16 10
The
Chinese
are
looking
to
regions
like
Africa
,
hoping
to
find
stable
trading
partners
.
29 18
They
do
not
share
the
political
evangelism
of
the
Americans
,
who
do
n't
just
want
to
trade
with
commodity
exporters
,
but
to
convert
them
as
well
.
18 15
Then
there
are
those
American
leaders
who
still
speak
of
making
the
US
self-sufficient
in
energy
supplies
.
16 9
But
this
is
basically
a
joke
:
self-indulgent
,
maybe
,
but
self-sufficient
,
never
.
25 12
Much
of
the
Arab
world
understandably
views
the
invasion
of
Iraq
as
the
cornerstone
of
the
real
US
strategy
for
securing
stable
energy
supplies
.
39 16
If
they
are
right
,
one
can
only
hope
that
America
has
a
plan
B.
Meanwhile
,
commodity
prices
will
continue
to
rise
,
with
oil
exporters
now
constituting
the
largest
contributors
to
America
's
gaping
trade
deficit
.
26 20
Maybe
the
real
US
strategy
is
to
try
to
owe
the
commodity-exporting
countries
so
much
money
that
they
will
feel
dependent
on
making
America
happy
!
11 10
That
is
one
twist
that
Prebisch
would
never
have
anticipated
.
35 12
Iran
's
Hardline
Choice
Iran
's
choice
for
its
next
president
,
the
hardline
Mayor
of
Teheran
Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad
,
is
likely
to
worsen
relations
with
the
West
and
the
country
's
international
isolation
.
24 16
Yet
in
domestic
terms
the
Islamist
regime
is
likely
to
be
better
off
than
it
would
have
been
with
a
more
moderate
result
.
10 7
Clearly
,
Ahmadinejad
has
a
real
base
of
support
.
56 16
But
the
fact
that
he
ran
as
a
populist
,
talked
about
helping
the
poor
,
condemned
the
government
's
performance
,
and
acted
almost
like
an
opposition
candidate
are
all
irrelevant
:
he
was
the
regime
's
choice
,
and
,
in
the
end
,
he
received
official
help
even
against
rival
hardline
candidates
.
7 5
The
regime
played
its
hand
brilliantly
.
30 11
It
turned
the
slightly
more
pragmatic
Hashemi
Rafsanjani
,
who
disagreed
with
some
current
policies
,
into
the
``
establishment
''
figure
and
its
own
man
into
the
rebel
.
12 8
The
government
thus
used
anti-establishment
feeling
to
revitalize
its
own
rule
.
40 13
Given
the
fact
that
the
last
president
,
Muhammad
Khatami
,
was
a
supporter
of
the
reform
movement
--
albeit
a
timid
one
who
ultimately
accomplished
nothing
--
only
underlines
how
thoroughly
the
rulers
turned
around
the
political
situation
.
17 12
Ahmadinejad
is
a
representative
of
the
younger
activists
in
the
anti-Shah
revolution
of
a
quarter-century
ago
.
24 13
He
was
directly
involved
in
the
holding
of
American
hostages
in
Iran
,
though
exactly
how
much
so
remains
a
matter
of
dispute
.
32 14
Most
worrisome
of
all
,
he
is
close
to
the
two
main
groups
that
represent
the
most
extreme
elements
in
Iran
:
the
Islamic
Revolutionary
Guard
Corps
and
the
Basij
organization
.
24 12
The
first
is
a
parallel
pro-regime
army
;
the
second
is
an
organization
for
intimidating
opponents
and
anyone
seeking
a
more
open
society
.
20 10
However
,
concern
that
an
even
more
radical
leadership
has
taken
over
in
Iran
is
mitigated
by
two
factors
.
31 18
First
,
Ahmadinejad
is
more
likely
to
focus
on
domestic
issues
,
trying
--
with
whatever
degree
of
success
is
unclear
--
to
improve
living
standards
for
the
poorest
Iranians
.
24 10
Second
,
the
same
group
that
has
been
in
control
ever
since
the
revolution
will
basically
continue
to
run
ideological
and
foreign
policy
.
18 8
The
president
has
fewer
powers
than
it
seems
,
overshadowed
particularly
by
Supreme
Guide
Ayatollah
Ali
Khamenei
.
20 11
Nevertheless
,
Ahmadinejad
's
election
starkly
clarifies
the
challenge
that
Iran
poses
for
Western
policy
and
Middle
East
stability
.
59 13
First
and
foremost
,
it
sends
a
signal
to
the
most
extreme
elements
in
Iran
and
that
country
's
terrorist
clients
--
Lebanon
's
Hezbollah
,
the
Palestinian
Hamas
and
Islamic
Jihad
,
and
various
small
groups
operating
against
Saudi
Arabia
,
Iraq
,
and
other
Arab
countries
--
that
they
have
a
green
light
for
launching
attacks
.
14 15
They
are
likely
to
assume
that
Iran
will
support
them
whatever
they
do
.
27 9
Outwardly
,
Iran
has
often
been
relatively
cautious
,
but
,
at
the
covert
level
,
it
has
been
the
world
's
leading
sponsor
of
terror
.
26 11
Sometimes
individual
Iranian
officials
may
have
acted
on
their
own
to
order
and
coordinate
specific
operations
;
they
will
now
feel
freer
to
do
so
.
14 8
Moreover
,
Ahmadinejad
openly
advocates
Iran
's
crash
program
to
obtain
nuclear
weapons
.
28 10
Most
Iranian
politicians
--
at
least
those
allowed
by
the
government
to
function
openly
--
support
the
program
,
but
favor
a
quieter
and
more
cautious
approach
.
22 11
Rafsanjani
,
for
example
,
put
building
better
economic
relations
with
the
West
ahead
of
pushing
forward
on
the
nuclear
front
.
22 10
If
Ahmadinejad
is
president
of
a
nuclear
Iran
,
he
is
more
likely
to
use
the
weapons
in
an
adventurous
manner
.
29 14
This
does
not
mean
that
he
would
fire
them
,
but
rather
that
he
would
use
them
for
purposes
of
diplomatic
blackmail
,
raising
threats
to
crisis
levels
.
42 14
Since
Iranian
leaders
daily
proclaim
their
desire
to
wipe
Israel
off
the
map
and
to
fight
the
US
-LRB-
Ahmadinejad
stepped
on
a
picture
of
an
American
flag
on
his
way
to
vote
-RRB-
,
the
risk
of
confrontation
has
increased
.
28 15
Finally
,
Ahmadinejad
is
likely
to
be
bolder
in
subverting
stability
in
Iraq
,
and
his
victory
will
encourage
radical
Iranian
officials
and
extremists
within
Iraq
itself
.
20 13
Iran
is
already
sending
many
agents
into
Iraq
and
supporting
clients
seeking
to
turn
that
country
into
a
clone
.
21 11
Iraqis
,
including
Shia
Muslims
--
who
follow
the
same
version
of
Islam
as
Iranians
--
generally
reject
such
interference
.
22 11
A
more
militant
Iranian
posture
is
likely
to
increase
friction
with
Iraq
,
as
well
as
inspire
more
anti-American
violence
there
.
38 13
In
short
,
Iran
's
electoral
outcome
is
a
dangerous
one
,
though
precisely
how
destabilizing
it
ultimately
turns
out
to
be
will
depend
on
Ahmadinejad
's
actions
and
the
degree
of
power
granted
him
by
Khamenei
.
35 11
Moreover
,
dealing
with
such
an
openly
extreme
Iran
--
radical
even
by
the
hardline
regime
's
standards
--
will
be
a
challenge
not
just
for
the
US
,
but
for
Europe
as
well
.
30 14
Will
European
countries
try
to
pretend
that
Ahmadinejad
's
militant
rhetoric
and
provocations
do
n't
matter
and
that
some
diplomatic
solution
to
Iran
's
nuclear
ambition
can
be
found
?
19 10
With
Rafsanjani
,
either
a
real
agreement
or
the
pretense
of
cooperation
would
have
been
easy
to
maintain
.
23 9
But
,
with
Ahmadinejad
,
a
high
level
of
appeasement
will
be
necessary
for
even
the
most
minimal
diplomatic
process
to
continue
.
36 17
Some
Iranian
reformers
and
exiles
put
a
bright
face
on
Ahmadinejad
's
election
,
arguing
that
his
administration
is
more
likely
to
show
the
regime
's
real
face
and
disabuse
any
Western
hopes
of
compromise
.
20 9
Yet
it
may
also
represent
the
regime
's
success
at
co-opting
dissatisfaction
with
a
quarter-century
of
radical
Islamist
rule
.
24 12
Whatever
the
outcome
,
for
the
West
,
Ahmadinejad
's
victory
means
that
everything
related
to
Iran
is
set
to
become
even
hotter
.
23 11
Take
From
the
Poor
,
Give
to
the
Rich
President
Bush
seems
poised
to
wreck
America
's
budget
for
years
to
come
.
20 8
When
Bush
came
into
office
,
the
outlook
was
for
budget
surpluses
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
.
38 10
Today
,
through
a
combination
of
irresponsible
Republican-led
tax
cuts
,
a
slowing
economy
,
the
bursting
of
the
stock
market
bubble
,
and
a
massive
increase
in
defense
spending
,
huge
deficits
dominate
the
fiscal
horizon
.
20 13
Worse
is
coming
,
because
the
Bush
Administration
and
the
Republican-led
Congress
are
preparing
to
deepen
the
fiscal
mess
.
18 8
The
damage
they
will
do
will
likely
weaken
the
US
and
add
instability
to
the
world
economy
.
11 6
Traditionally
,
America
's
Republican
Party
stood
for
balanced
budgets
.
22 11
This
changed
with
the
Reagan
Administration
,
when
conservative
Republicans
favored
tax
cuts
even
at
the
cost
of
large
budget
deficits
.
30 12
President
Reagan
told
the
American
people
that
they
could
enjoy
tax
cuts
,
a
military
build-up
,
and
continuation
of
their
favorite
spending
programs
all
at
the
same
time
.
20 12
The
result
-
no
surprise
-
was
a
series
of
vast
budget
deficits
that
took
years
to
clean
up
.
19 8
Both
President
George
Bush
Sr.
and
Bill
Clinton
had
to
raise
taxes
to
clean
up
the
Reagan-era
mess
.
17 8
Those
tax
increases
probably
contributed
to
President
Bush
Sr
's
defeat
by
Bill
Clinton
in
1992
.
27 12
Yet
Clinton
bravely
decided
to
complete
the
process
of
restoring
fiscal
balance
,
in
part
to
protect
the
long-term
financing
of
the
Social
Security
retirement
program
.
16 8
When
Clinton
left
office
in
2000
,
the
budget
situation
was
the
best
in
decades
.
32 10
Then
along
came
President
George
Bush
Jr.
to
replay
Reagan
:
large
tax
cuts
,
a
big
increase
in
military
spending
,
and
continuation
or
even
expansion
of
popular
spending
programs
.
5 5
The
result
was
predictable
.
23 11
In
January
2001
,
the
cumulative
budget
outcome
for
the
years
2002-2011
was
projected
to
be
$
5.6
trillion
dollars
in
surplus
.
9 5
By
mid-2002
,
those
projected
surpluses
had
vanished
.
35 13
In
view
of
these
changed
economic
conditions
,
and
the
shadow
of
war
in
Iraq
,
you
might
expect
the
Bush
Administration
and
the
Republican-led
Congress
to
be
cautious
in
advocating
new
tax
cuts
.
19 13
But
no
,
their
highest
priority
is
to
enact
more
tax
cuts
that
will
mainly
benefit
the
rich
.
16 9
At
the
same
time
,
the
Administration
is
calling
for
big
increases
in
military
spending
.
27 10
With
the
November
2004
presidential
election
now
coming
into
view
,
you
can
be
certain
that
no
meaningful
cuts
in
non-military
spending
programs
will
be
made
.
9 7
So
massive
budget
deficits
seem
here
to
stay
.
32 11
If
domestic
spending
simply
stays
constant
as
a
fraction
of
national
income
,
the
cumulative
budget
outcome
for
the
next
ten
years
will
be
a
combined
deficit
of
$
1.5
trillion
.
43 19
But
this
figure
may
be
optimistic
,
because
it
probably
does
n't
adequately
factor
in
the
costs
of
a
possible
war
in
Iraq
,
nor
another
round
of
tax
cuts
,
nor
the
risk
of
higher
interest
rates
in
the
years
ahead
.
9 7
Why
are
Republicans
so
unconcerned
about
this
mess
?
18 11
Some
Republican
care
more
about
tax
cuts
for
the
rich
than
they
do
about
almost
anything
else
.
25 16
Others
believe
that
deficits
will
force
major
cuts
in
domestic
government
spending
,
thus
shrinking
the
state
,
which
is
their
heart
's
desire
.
23 10
The
problem
with
this
latter
view
is
that
most
taxpayers
like
domestic
programs
,
and
will
not
readily
support
major
spending
cuts
.
23 17
A
more
intriguing
question
is
why
do
Americans
vote
for
such
policies
,
when
they
should
know
that
trouble
will
probably
result
.
14 9
One
answer
is
that
many
voters
do
not
see
the
looming
budget
troubles
.
15 10
A
better
answer
is
that
most
Americans
did
not
actually
vote
for
these
policies
.
29 13
Voter
turnout
in
the
2002
election
was
only
around
40
%
,
of
which
around
half
went
to
the
Republicans
,
or
around
20
%
of
eligible
voters
.
11 6
Of
course
,
the
outlook
need
not
be
so
bleak
.
7 6
War
in
Iraq
may
be
avoided
.
10 8
Proposed
tax
cuts
may
be
watered
down
or
abandoned
.
28 11
But
I
predict
large
budget
deficits
for
years
to
come
,
and
a
growing
sense
of
unease
within
the
US
and
abroad
about
America
's
macroeconomic
situation
.
19 13
Foreign
investors
may
decide
to
cut
back
financing
America
's
budget
and
current
account
deficits
on
favorable
terms
.
14 7
The
dollar
may
weaken
,
and
fears
of
inflation
may
become
more
pronounced
.
19 8
All
of
this
will
make
US
policymakers
less
confident
and
less
flexible
in
their
responses
to
economic
shocks
.
53 20
The
poor
,
both
inside
the
US
and
abroad
,
could
suffer
the
most
,
as
President
Bush
and
the
Congress
tell
the
American
people
and
the
world
that
,
due
to
the
large
budget
deficits
,
there
is
no
money
available
to
address
problems
of
poverty
,
disease
,
and
education
.
34 12
Unless
ordinary
Americans
wake
up
to
these
fiscal
risks
,
the
rich
may
walk
away
with
another
multi-billion-dollar
gift
as
the
country
and
the
world
bear
the
harsh
consequences
for
years
to
come
.
33 9
Lessons
from
America
's
Fiscal
Recklessness
George
W.
Bush
has
done
more
to
wreck
US
economic
policy
than
any
other
President
in
American
history
,
exceeding
even
his
mentor
,
Ronald
Reagan
.
31 15
In
just
three
years
in
office
,
he
has
destroyed
a
fragile
political
consensus
that
had
taken
a
decade
to
construct
,
and
that
could
take
another
decade
to
re-create
.
16 8
In
doing
so
,
Bush
has
risked
America
's
long-term
economic
health
and
social
stability
.
27 10
Because
the
long-term
budgetary
challenges
that
the
US
is
so
badly
mismanaging
are
not
unique
,
America
's
fiscal
blunders
provide
important
lessons
for
other
countries
.
35 20
The
main
problem
with
fiscal
policy
is
that
politicians
can
easily
make
themselves
temporarily
popular
by
cutting
taxes
and
increasing
public
spending
while
running
up
massive
public
debts
,
leaving
repayment
to
the
future
.
25 8
This
trick
can
last
a
few
years
,
but
sooner
rather
than
later
budget
deficits
and
growing
public
debt
force
a
painful
policy
reversal
.
18 9
Yet
a
cynical
politician
can
buy
himself
re-election
and
perhaps
be
in
retirement
when
the
crisis
arrives
.
27 17
One
would
imagine
that
after
hundreds
of
such
episodes
of
fiscal
irresponsibility
around
the
world
in
recent
decades
,
voters
would
be
allergic
to
such
tricks
.
30 11
Yet
Bush
is
doing
it
again
,
buying
popularity
today
by
doling
out
massive
tax
cuts
while
simultaneously
increasing
military
spending
and
even
raising
expenditure
on
education
and
health
.
15 10
The
result
is
a
budget
deficit
equivalent
to
more
than
5
%
of
GDP
.
20 11
What
's
worse
is
that
America
's
long-term
budgetary
prospects
were
already
troubling
before
Bush
began
his
reckless
policies
.
25 13
The
US
population
is
aging
,
so
there
will
be
a
sharp
increase
in
the
costs
of
publicly
funded
health
care
and
pension
systems
.
42 23
Careful
calculations
show
that
future
revenues
under
the
tax
policies
favored
by
Bush
are
likely
to
fall
tens
of
trillions
of
dollars
short
of
the
costs
of
public
pensions
,
health
care
,
and
other
fiscal
spending
expected
by
the
public
.
34 13
At
some
point
in
the
future
,
there
will
thus
need
to
be
steep
increases
in
tax
collections
,
sharp
cuts
in
public
spending
,
or
both
,
to
correct
Bush
's
actions
.
9 6
So
why
does
the
public
support
his
policies
?
22 9
Because
the
public
has
little
understanding
or
concern
about
these
long-term
consequences
,
even
though
they
will
eventually
hurt
most
Americans
.
19 10
The
richest
taxpayers
are
,
of
course
,
happy
because
they
received
the
bulk
of
the
tax
cuts
.
47 11
Amazingly
,
the
richest
5
%
of
US
taxpayers
received
almost
half
of
the
tax
cuts
,
and
these
rich
taxpayers
clearly
expect
the
other
95
%
--
the
middle
class
and
the
poor
--
to
bear
most
of
the
future
spending
cuts
and
tax
increases
.
51 19
Meanwhile
,
Bush
has
convinced
many
poor
and
middle-class
voters
that
they
should
be
happy
,
too
,
without
telling
them
that
they
will
have
to
pay
for
their
small
tax
cuts
with
much
larger
cuts
in
future
government
services
if
his
administration
's
policies
prevail
in
the
long
term
.
27 10
If
Americans
had
a
political
memory
,
they
would
understand
that
they
already
rode
this
fiscal
``
roller
coaster
''
once
in
the
past
20
years
.
17 8
Ronald
Reagan
also
came
to
office
promising
massive
tax
cuts
and
large
increases
in
military
spending
.
15 8
The
result
was
a
huge
budget
deficit
by
the
middle
of
the
1980
's
.
14 11
Tax
cuts
made
Reagan
enormously
popular
and
helped
win
him
re-election
in
1984
.
36 13
It
then
took
over
a
decade
--
starting
in
Reagan
's
second
term
,
and
continuing
through
the
terms
of
George
Bush
,
Sr.
and
Bill
Clinton
--
to
get
the
budget
back
to
surplus
.
29 15
Of
course
,
this
meant
approving
fresh
tax
increases
,
which
cost
George
Bush
,
Sr.
his
re-election
and
led
to
the
polarized
politics
of
the
1990
's
.
6 5
History
will
almost
certainly
repeat
.
24 13
Some
right-wing
ideologues
in
the
Bush
administration
believe
that
today
's
budget
deficits
will
eventually
force
government
social
spending
to
be
cut
sharply
.
12 10
They
hope
to
dismantle
programs
such
as
Social
Security
and
Medicare
.
10 5
But
the
US
public
strongly
supports
these
social
programs
.
29 14
So
the
right-wing
strategy
of
cutting
taxes
first
in
order
to
force
cuts
in
social
programs
later
will
fail
,
and
eventually
tax
rates
will
have
to
rise
.
19 13
Others
in
the
Bush
administration
argue
that
tax
cuts
are
important
for
pulling
the
US
out
of
recession
.
6 5
This
argument
is
also
mistaken
.
17 9
America
's
economy
could
have
recovered
without
the
tax
cuts
,
and
perhaps
even
more
robustly
.
20 10
In
any
event
,
it
is
a
huge
mistake
to
base
long-term
tax
policies
on
the
short-run
business
cycle
.
9 7
There
are
two
vital
lessons
for
other
countries
.
19 10
The
first
is
that
the
looming
US
budget
deficits
will
sooner
or
later
limit
America
's
international
power
.
19 13
Americans
supported
the
Iraq
war
only
because
they
did
n't
have
to
pay
for
it
with
increased
taxes
.
26 13
When
Americans
are
forced
to
choose
between
foreign
adventures
and
higher
taxes
,
they
will
be
much
less
likely
to
support
expensive
military
operations
abroad
.
21 13
Indeed
,
the
US
will
be
deeply
divided
internally
as
the
public
grapples
with
the
fiscal
mess
left
by
Bush
.
23 15
The
second
lesson
is
that
countries
ought
to
plan
their
budgets
taking
into
account
the
rising
fiscal
costs
of
an
aging
population
.
14 9
Long-term
budgetary
conditions
are
rarely
in
clear
view
of
taxpayers
or
the
parliament
.
30 17
Governments
should
be
required
to
submit
long-term
budget
assessments
together
with
their
annual
budget
proposals
,
in
order
to
reduce
the
tendency
towards
short-run
political
manipulation
of
the
budget
.
12 7
The
US
can
serve
as
an
early
warning
to
other
countries
.
28 14
The
White
House
ought
to
provide
others
with
the
same
caveat
that
magicians
on
television
give
their
viewers
:
``
Do
not
try
this
at
home
.
''
30 11
The
Political
Stock
Market
Many
economic
and
financial
analysts
complain
that
emerging
countries
'
stock
markets
are
often
heavily
manipulated
by
their
governments
and
are
more
political
than
economic
.
38 17
The
unstated
assumption
seems
to
be
that
,
in
contrast
,
some
pristine
force
of
economic
nature
drives
stock
markets
in
advanced
countries
,
and
that
forecasting
their
performance
is
thus
like
forecasting
the
growth
of
trees
.
27 11
This
description
of
stock
markets
in
emerging
countries
is
not
wrong
,
just
biased
,
because
the
same
description
applies
to
stock
markets
in
advanced
countries
.
35 17
Indeed
,
the
best
analysts
know
that
forecasting
the
performance
of
any
country
's
stock
market
substantially
means
forecasting
how
well
the
government
wants
stock
market
investors
to
fare
in
the
current
political
environment
.
14 6
Consider
the
United
States
stock
market
,
by
far
the
world
's
largest
.
31 13
The
general
perception
is
that
the
government
leaves
companies
alone
and
that
the
returns
from
investing
in
the
US
stock
market
reflect
the
fundamental
forces
of
a
strong
capitalist
economy
.
18 13
This
is
one
reason
why
the
US
is
a
magnet
for
portfolio
investors
from
around
the
world
.
16 9
But
the
returns
that
make
US
stock
markets
so
attractive
reflect
a
delicate
political
balance
.
17 13
In
particular
,
tax
rates
that
affect
stocks
have
varied
through
time
as
political
pressures
change
.
32 8
During
World
War
II
,
for
example
,
political
support
for
great
fortunes
diminished
and
the
government
sharply
increased
taxes
on
capital
gains
,
dividends
,
and
high
incomes
in
general
.
36 12
When
World
War
II
produced
a
strong
recovery
from
the
Great
Depression
of
the
1930
's
,
President
Roosevelt
and
Congress
slapped
on
an
excess-profits
tax
to
ensure
that
shareholders
would
not
benefit
too
much
.
35 13
By
contrast
,
in
1980
,
when
there
was
no
war
but
the
stock
market
was
low
,
US
voters
elected
Ronald
Reagan
,
a
man
many
thought
too
right
wing
to
be
president
.
18 7
He
asked
for
-
and
got
-
cuts
in
capital
gains
,
dividend
,
and
income
taxes
.
20 9
Political
interference
in
the
stock
market
is
not
merely
about
taxes
on
capital
gains
,
dividends
,
and
income
.
42 10
Property
taxes
,
excise
taxes
,
import
duties
,
and
sales
taxes
-
all
of
which
are
paid
,
directly
or
indirectly
,
by
corporations
-
can
have
a
magnified
impact
on
corporate
profits
,
and
hence
on
the
stock
market
.
25 14
It
is
no
coincidence
that
wherever
stock
markets
thrive
,
governments
take
care
that
these
taxes
stop
well
short
of
destroying
after-tax
corporate
profits
.
13 7
Indeed
,
the
politics
of
stock
markets
does
not
stop
with
taxes
.
25 10
On
the
contrary
,
almost
every
activity
of
government
has
an
impact
on
corporate
profits
,
and
in
turn
,
on
the
stock
market
.
26 15
After
the
1929
stock
market
crash
the
US
government
suspended
much
anti-trust
activity
,
allowing
companies
to
acquire
monopoly
power
that
would
boost
their
value
.
30 18
This
policy
delayed
the
recovery
from
high
unemployment
,
but
even
that
was
not
enough
to
rein
in
the
political
forces
arrayed
in
favor
of
supporting
the
stock
market
.
36 19
Similarly
,
one
of
the
most
important
things
that
President
Reagan
did
was
to
destroy
much
of
the
remaining
power
of
America
's
labor
unions
,
which
compete
for
their
share
of
the
corporate
pie
.
37 13
Reagan
's
defeat
of
the
Air
Traffic
Controllers
'
strike
in
1981
was
a
watershed
event
for
the
US
labor
movement
-
and
for
the
stock
market
,
which
started
its
dramatic
bull
market
in
1982
.
30 15
The
US
government
has
been
particularly
aggressive
in
supporting
the
stock
market
since
the
peak
of
the
equities
price
bubble
in
2000
,
most
notably
cutting
interest
rates
repeatedly
.
20 11
Of
course
,
this
was
publicly
justified
in
terms
of
stimulating
the
economy
,
not
supporting
the
stock
market
.
32 16
But
it
is
a
telling
sign
of
the
US
stock
market
's
significance
that
one
of
the
most
important
factors
perceived
to
be
weighing
on
the
economy
was
declining
equity
prices
.
13 7
Indeed
,
the
authorities
'
response
was
not
limited
to
monetary
stimulus
.
70 16
The
US
National
Income
and
Product
Accounts
show
that
the
effective
rate
of
corporate
profits
tax
-LRB-
the
percentage
of
profits
actually
paid
to
the
government
in
taxes
-RRB-
crested
at
33.7
%
in
the
first
quarter
of
2000
-
the
peak
of
the
stock
market
and
the
economy
in
general
-
and
fell
to
20.2
%
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
2003
,
when
the
market
was
down
.
37 14
Much
of
that
decline
reflects
explicit
tax
relief
measures
voted
by
Congress
,
as
well
as
the
perception
among
corporations
that
in
the
current
economic
and
political
environment
they
can
be
more
aggressive
in
tax
avoidance
.
43 14
Moreover
,
after
the
stock
market
crash
,
the
maximum
tax
on
dividends
paid
on
stocks
was
slashed
from
35
%
to
15
%
,
giving
a
substantial
new
advantage
to
long-term
investors
and
boosting
the
compounding
effect
of
reinvesting
after-tax
dividends
.
33 23
Again
,
this
tax
cut
was
justified
in
terms
of
stimulating
the
economy
,
which
can
,
of
course
,
be
said
of
practically
any
measure
aimed
at
supporting
the
stock
market
.
18 13
But
it
is
the
balance
of
political
forces
that
determines
whether
such
a
justification
will
be
credible
.
55 16
One
might
say
that
the
same
variables
,
including
hostility
to
high
taxes
and
a
weak
labor
movement
,
have
operated
in
the
US
for
the
past
200
years
-
and
can
thus
be
expected
to
continue
operating
in
the
future
,
producing
high
stock
market
returns
and
attracting
huge
inflows
of
foreign
investment
.
24 14
Those
who
believe
that
investments
in
the
US
stock
market
will
maintain
the
same
strong
growth
trend
for
decades
may
well
be
right
.
11 11
But
one
should
be
clear
about
what
one
is
forecasting
.
25 12
Essentially
,
one
is
forecasting
not
just
economics
,
but
politics
-
and
even
the
cultural
values
-
that
shape
economic
policies
and
performance
.
32 14
The
Global
Home
Homes
are
the
most
local
of
investments
,
rooted
to
a
particular
place
like
a
tree
,
and
thus
thriving
or
withering
in
response
to
local
economic
conditions
.
35 11
The
whole
world
flashes
by
on
our
television
screens
,
but
the
market
for
our
homes
,
which
is
comprised
almost
entirely
of
local
amateurs
,
remains
grounded
right
there
in
our
own
backyard
.
9 5
Soon
,
however
,
this
could
all
change
.
47 11
Within
a
month
,
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
-LRB-
CME
-RRB-
,
in
collaboration
with
my
company
,
MacroMarkets
,
as
well
as
Fiserv
and
Standard
&
Poor
's
,
will
launch
futures
and
options
contracts
on
home
prices
in
ten
cities
in
the
United
States
.
33 17
The
contracts
will
be
settled
on
the
S&P
/
Case-Shiller
Home
Price
Indices
,
which
developed
out
of
academic
work
that
my
colleague
Karl
Case
and
I
pioneered
almost
twenty
years
ago
.
27 13
For
many
years
we
have
been
campaigning
for
housing
futures
,
but
no
exchange
wanted
to
use
such
indices
to
create
a
futures
market
until
now
.
28 12
The
futures
markets
on
home
prices
will
allow
investors
around
the
world
to
invest
in
US
homes
indirectly
,
by
buying
interests
in
them
through
these
markets
.
30 14
An
investor
in
Paris
,
Rio
de
Janeiro
,
or
Tokyo
will
be
able
to
invest
in
owner-occupied
homes
in
New
York
,
Los
Angeles
,
and
Las
Vegas
.
27 9
A
fundamental
principle
of
financial
theory
--
``
diversification
''
or
``
risk
spreading
''
--
implies
that
interest
in
the
new
contracts
will
be
high
.
33 10
People
and
businesses
in
New
York
,
for
example
,
are
overexposed
to
their
local
real
estate
risks
,
so
they
should
reduce
this
risk
by
selling
New
York
home
price
futures
.
22 12
People
in
Tokyo
will
assume
some
of
this
risk
by
purchasing
New
York
home
price
futures
if
the
price
is
right
.
20 7
The
New
Yorkers
still
live
in
their
own
homes
,
but
now
they
have
spread
their
investment
risk
worldwide
.
38 16
A
genuine
futures
market
on
single-family
homes
has
not
been
attempted
since
1991
when
the
London
Futures
and
Options
Exchange
-LRB-
now
merged
into
Euronext.liffe
-RRB-
failed
in
its
effort
to
launch
such
a
market
in
Britain
.
8 5
That
attempt
never
generated
much
trading
volume
.
10 8
The
Exchange
threw
a
party
and
no
one
came
.
20 7
British
spread-betting
markets
for
home
prices
,
and
some
retail
online
markets
,
have
never
amounted
to
much
either
.
7 5
Will
it
be
different
this
time
?
42 13
To
be
sure
,
starting
a
new
market
is
always
an
uncertain
proposition
:
people
want
to
go
to
parties
only
if
a
lot
of
other
people
are
there
;
if
no
one
is
there
,
no
one
wants
to
come
.
23 15
Likewise
,
in
markets
without
many
investors
,
not
enough
trades
can
be
executed
to
generate
the
returns
needed
to
attract
them
.
35 12
As
is
often
true
of
great
parties
,
it
can
be
a
bit
of
a
mystery
how
substantial
new
markets
get
started
,
but
we
know
that
it
does
happen
from
time
to
time
.
30 10
Initial
indications
suggest
growing
interest
in
futures
trading
for
home
prices
,
particularly
as
so
much
talk
about
the
``
housing
bubble
''
underscores
the
importance
of
diversifying
risk
.
48 18
After
the
CME
's
announcement
,
one
of
its
competitors
,
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
said
that
it
plans
to
create
futures
and
options
contracts
on
major
US
regions
,
to
be
based
on
the
median
home
price
published
by
the
National
Association
of
Realtors
.
44 13
But
,
aside
from
strong
public
interest
in
investing
in
housing
and
in
hedging
housing
risks
,
another
critical
issue
must
be
resolved
if
futures
markets
are
to
succeed
:
prices
must
be
revealed
,
and
investors
must
understand
what
these
prices
mean
.
30 16
I
believe
there
is
a
very
good
chance
that
many
of
these
futures
markets
will
soon
be
predicting
substantial
price
declines
in
some
US
cities
over
the
next
year
.
28 11
They
will
be
in
what
traders
call
``
backwardation
''
:
the
future
price
in
the
market
today
is
lower
than
the
price
of
a
home
today
.
30 14
Maybe
backwardation
wo
n't
appear
on
the
first
day
that
housing
futures
are
traded
,
but
there
is
a
good
chance
it
will
come
within
a
matter
of
months
.
17 12
We
may
need
backwardation
in
some
of
these
markets
if
they
are
to
fulfill
their
function
.
27 13
Everyone
knows
that
there
has
been
a
huge
real
estate
boom
in
many
of
these
cities
-LRB-
and
elsewhere
in
the
world
-RRB-
in
recent
years
.
36 17
International
investors
are
not
likely
to
want
to
invest
in
these
cities
unless
expectations
of
a
price
decline
are
built
into
the
futures
markets
,
as
people
in
Tokyo
understand
from
their
own
bitter
experience
.
48 13
But
if
backwardation
is
strong
enough
,
even
investors
who
think
that
the
US
housing
market
is
headed
for
a
fall
will
still
be
able
to
expect
a
good
return
from
home
price
futures
,
because
they
are
already
getting
a
discounted
price
in
the
futures
market
.
29 19
Nevertheless
,
it
will
require
some
adjustment
for
New
Yorkers
seeking
to
hedge
their
own
real
estate
investments
to
sell
futures
contracts
that
have
a
built-in
price
decline
.
37 18
They
will
have
to
get
used
to
the
idea
that
the
market
already
expects
the
decline
,
and
that
they
can
protect
themselves
only
for
that
margin
of
possible
future
price
declines
that
exceed
this
expectation
.
20 10
In
fact
,
such
adjustments
in
our
thinking
will
likely
occur
when
we
actually
see
the
futures
market
prices
.
19 8
Until
now
,
the
future
course
of
real
estate
prices
has
been
merely
a
matter
of
diverse
opinion
.
41 15
When
markets
create
an
international
consensus
on
the
future
price
of
homes
in
cities
around
the
world
,
we
will
be
better
able
to
manage
the
risks
facing
these
cities
,
thereby
stabilizing
their
economies
--
and
our
own
lives
.

What
News
Is
Moving
the
Markets
?
43 15
Stock
markets
in
much
of
the
world
have
shown
sharp
cumulative
declines
since
around
May
10
,
with
most
of
the
drop
occurring
in
the
two-week
period
to
around
May
23
,
but
with
prices
continuing
to
fall
on
average
since
then
.
15 7
Does
trouble
in
the
world
's
stock
markets
mean
trouble
for
the
world
economy
?
8 8
Let
us
look
at
the
biggest
declines
.
27 11
Of
the
major
countries
'
indexes
,
the
biggest
crash
was
in
India
,
where
stock
prices
fell
16.9
%
from
May
10
to
May
22
.
55 12
The
debacle
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
was
almost
as
big
and
the
peaks
and
troughs
were
within
a
day
or
two
of
those
in
India
:
in
Argentina
,
stock
prices
fell
16.1
%
,
in
Brazil
,
they
fell
14.7
%
,
and
in
Mexico
,
they
fell
13.8
%
.
7 5
European
markets
also
suffered
large
losses
.
43 10
In
Sweden
,
stock
prices
fell
15.2
%
between
May
9
and
May
22
;
over
nearly
the
same
period
,
prices
fell
9.7
%
in
Germany
,
9.4
%
in
France
and
the
United
Kingdom
,
and
9.3
%
in
Italy
.
38 8
Likewise
,
in
Asia
,
stock
prices
fell
11.5
%
in
Korea
,
9.3
%
in
Hong
Kong
,
and
8
%
in
Japan
from
their
respective
peaks
to
troughs
over
very
nearly
the
same
time
period
.
13 10
Many
commentators
try
to
tie
such
events
to
developments
the
United
States
.
15 8
But
US
stock
prices
fell
only
5.2
%
between
May
9
and
May
24
.
21 12
Nor
does
China
appear
to
be
behind
the
global
decline
,
since
stock
prices
there
actually
rose
during
this
period
.
9 6
Economists
'
standard
explanation
revolves
around
monetary
policy
.
31 9
In
the
wake
of
the
great
deflation
scare
of
2003
,
central
banks
around
the
world
cut
interest
rates
,
setting
off
speculative
booms
in
both
stock
and
housing
markets
.
24 13
But
now
,
according
to
this
view
,
rising
interest
rates
are
beginning
to
bite
,
which
portends
further
declines
in
asset
prices
.
12 9
There
is
certainly
an
important
element
of
truth
in
this
argument
.
32 12
The
US
Federal
Reserve
did
indeed
raise
rates
on
May
10
,
and
its
chairman
,
Ben
Bernanke
,
indicated
then
that
there
may
be
further
rate
increases
in
the
future
.
19 12
Worsening
US
inflation
data
were
reported
on
May
17
,
suggesting
that
further
monetary
tightening
is
in
store
.
20 18
Economists
like
to
view
the
world
as
logical
and
manageable
,
which
implies
that
they
understand
what
is
happening
.
14 7
But
,
in
doing
so
,
they
often
exaggerate
central
banks
'
role
.
22 10
Indeed
,
the
US
rate
increase
was
just
one
in
a
series
of
rate
hikes
--
the
16th
in
a
row
.
68 23
No
other
major
central
bank
raised
rates
after
the
stock
market
drops
began
in
May
until
June
7
-
8
,
when
several
did
-LRB-
the
European
Central
Bank
,
India
,
South
Korea
,
South
Africa
,
Thailand
and
Turkey
-RRB-
Another
factor
is
the
price
of
oil
,
which
rose
24
%
from
March
22
to
May
2
,
setting
all-time
records
along
the
way
.
18 11
Surely
,
this
was
a
major
event
that
would
plausibly
affect
stock
markets
all
over
the
world
.
17 10
Oil
price
increases
have
been
a
culprit
in
virtually
every
economic
recession
since
World
War
II
.
23 9
Still
,
the
oil
price
increases
do
not
correspond
to
the
time
interval
in
mid-May
when
stock
market
indexes
fell
most
sharply
.
19 12
To
argue
that
oil
price
increases
caused
the
stock
market
declines
presupposes
a
time
lag
of
several
weeks
.
21 9
But
stock
markets
are
not
very
logical
,
and
there
could
be
a
lagged
response
to
the
oil
price
shocks
.
14 8
As
with
any
other
prices
in
financial
markets
,
an
increase
attracts
attention
.
32 12
When
oil
prices
rise
quickly
,
people
watch
the
news
related
to
oil
prices
and
talk
to
each
other
more
about
oil
prices
,
hence
creating
heightened
sensitivity
to
this
news
.
20 8
The
crisis
in
the
Middle
East
is
tied
to
oil
prices
,
and
it
dominated
the
news
in
May
.
23 8
Ominous
signs
and
strong
language
used
by
various
political
figures
were
possibly
amplified
in
investors
'
minds
by
the
oil
price
increases
.
40 14
On
May
8
,
Israeli
Vice
Premier
Shimon
Peres
,
reacting
to
hostile
statements
by
Iranian
President
Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad
,
said
that
``
the
president
of
Iran
should
remember
that
Iran
can
also
be
wiped
off
the
map
.
''
51 16
Similarly
,
near
the
beginning
of
the
May
stock
market
tumble
,
Ahmadinejad
visited
Indonesia
,
the
world
's
most
populous
country
with
a
Muslim
majority
,
and
newspapers
reported
on
May
13
that
he
had
received
a
standing
ovation
from
students
at
two
of
the
country
's
top
universities
.
42 18
This
story
might
have
been
interpreted
as
evidence
that
Ahmadinejad
's
brinkmanship
on
the
nuclear
issue
was
paying
off
for
him
politically
,
fueling
a
perception
that
the
tense
situation
in
the
Middle
East
might
lead
to
even
higher
oil
prices
.
17 9
These
news
stories
may
seem
far
more
remote
from
the
stock
market
than
is
monetary
policy
.
26 11
But
public
reaction
to
them
,
together
with
recent
oil
price
increases
,
may
well
account
in
good
measure
for
the
change
in
market
psychology
.
21 8
Attitudes
toward
risks
change
over
time
,
and
events
like
Ahmadinejad
's
and
Peres
's
remarks
can
precipitate
such
changes
.
47 19
So
,
while
these
things
happen
in
ways
that
are
hard
to
quantify
,
maybe
analysts
should
pay
attention
to
the
words
of
Ahmadinejad
just
as
carefully
as
they
do
to
those
of
Bernanke
in
trying
to
understand
the
direction
of
the
world
's
stock
markets
.
26 12
Economists
might
not
like
to
focus
on
the
public
mindset
and
how
it
interacts
with
price
changes
,
world
news
stories
,
and
speculative
dynamics
.
24 13
After
all
,
doing
so
implies
that
economic
events
are
less
predictable
-LRB-
and
economists
less
omniscient
-RRB-
than
they
like
to
imagine
.
8 6
But
such
a
focus
makes
intuitive
sense
.
8 8
What
is
really
on
investors
'
minds
?
10 6
Ahmadinejad
is
a
charismatic
figure
;
Bernanke
is
not
.
11 8
Ahmadinejad
is
embarking
on
an
adventure
;
Bernanke
is
not
.
16 7
And
,
perhaps
most
importantly
,
Ahmadinejad
is
a
destabilizing
influence
;
Bernanke
is
not
.
23 8
Indeed
,
whatever
their
ultimate
cause
,
the
mid-May
drops
in
stock
prices
throughout
the
world
are
indicative
of
unstable
market
psychology
.
43 20
It
is
difficult
to
believe
that
they
were
related
only
to
opinions
about
likely
monetary
policy
,
and
not
to
larger
and
deeper
issues
,
including
such
things
as
energy
and
political
tension
,
that
underpin
the
performance
of
the
world
economy
.

Why
Pay
More
for
Fairness
?
45 11
Marks
&
Spencer
,
a
supermarket
and
clothing
chain
with
400
stores
throughout
Britain
,
recently
announced
that
it
is
converting
its
entire
range
of
coffee
and
tea
,
totaling
38
lines
,
to
Fairtrade
,
a
marketing
symbol
of
``
ethical
production
.
''
17 7
The
chain
already
sells
only
Fairtrade
tea
and
coffee
in
its
200
Café
Revive
coffee
shops
.
16 12
It
is
also
boosting
its
purchases
of
shirts
and
other
goods
made
with
Fairtrade
cotton
.
34 12
The
announcement
came
during
``
Fairtrade
Fortnight
,
''
a
two-week
promotion
of
Fairtrade
products
that
included
speaking
tours
by
farmers
from
developing
countries
,
telling
Britons
how
Fairtrade
has
assisted
their
communities
.
37 13
The
movement
toward
more
ethical
consumption
has
made
significant
gains
in
the
United
States
as
well
,
as
consumers
increasingly
turn
to
organic
,
locally
produced
foods
,
and
eggs
from
hens
not
kept
in
cages
.
35 20
In
the
UK
,
a
survey
has
found
that
half
of
those
shown
the
Fairtrade
symbol
recognized
it
and
understood
that
it
refers
to
products
that
give
a
better
deal
for
Third
World
farmers
.
27 10
There
is
no
comparable
US
research
,
but
related
data
,
and
discussions
with
my
own
students
,
suggests
that
the
figure
would
be
much
lower
.
22 14
Traders
seeking
Fairtrade
certification
must
pay
producers
a
price
that
covers
the
costs
of
sustainable
production
and
provides
a
living
wage
.
24 8
For
example
,
the
minimum
price
for
coffee
is
$
1.26
per
pound
,
no
matter
how
low
the
market
price
may
fall
.
25 12
If
the
market
price
rises
above
that
figure
,
the
fair
trade
price
will
increase
so
that
it
remains
five
cents
per
pound
higher
.
22 16
Small
farmers
,
for
their
part
,
are
required
to
be
organized
in
cooperatives
or
other
groups
that
allow
democratic
participation
.
57 12
Plantations
and
factories
can
use
the
Fairtrade
label
if
they
pay
their
workers
decent
wages
,
comply
with
health
,
safety
,
and
environmental
standards
,
allow
unions
or
other
forms
of
workers
'
associations
,
provide
good
housing
if
workers
are
not
living
at
home
,
and
do
not
use
child
labor
or
forced
labor
.
7 6
Not
every
one
approves
of
Fairtrade
.
31 9
Brink
Lindsey
,
director
of
the
pro-market
Cato
Institute
's
Center
for
Trade
Policy
Studies
,
believes
that
the
campaign
for
Fairtrade
coffee
is
a
``
well-meaning
dead
end
.
''
53 21
With
some
justification
,
he
argues
that
the
real
cause
of
the
fall
in
coffee
prices
was
not
the
profiteering
of
multinationals
,
but
big
increases
in
coffee
production
in
Brazil
and
Vietnam
,
combined
with
new
techniques
that
make
it
possible
to
grow
coffee
with
less
labor
and
hence
more
cheaply
.
63 19
In
Lindsey
's
view
,
if
we
want
to
assist
coffee
growers
,
we
should
encourage
them
either
to
abandon
coffee
and
produce
more
profitable
crops
--
and
here
he
rightly
points
to
rich
nations
'
trade
barriers
and
subsidies
as
obstacles
that
must
be
dismantled
--
or
to
move
into
higher-value
products
,
like
specialty
coffees
,
that
bring
higher
prices
.
40 23
What
is
curious
about
Lindsey
's
argument
,
however
,
is
that
the
Fairtrade
coffee
campaign
can
be
seen
as
doing
just
what
he
recommends
--
encouraging
coffee
farmers
to
produce
a
specialty
coffee
that
brings
a
higher
price
.
17 12
Pro-market
economists
do
n't
object
to
corporations
that
blatantly
use
snob
appeal
to
promote
their
products
.
34 15
If
people
want
to
pay
$
48
for
a
pound
of
Jamaican
Blue
Mountain
coffee
because
that
's
what
James
Bond
prefers
,
economists
do
n't
object
that
the
market
is
being
distorted
.
48 29
So
why
be
critical
when
consumers
choose
to
pay
$
12
for
a
pound
of
coffee
that
they
know
has
been
grown
without
toxic
chemicals
,
under
shade
trees
that
help
birds
to
survive
,
by
farmers
who
can
now
afford
to
feed
and
educate
their
children
?
51 21
Economists
might
reply
that
if
you
want
to
help
people
feed
and
educate
their
children
,
you
can
pay
$
10
for
a
pound
of
non-Fairtrade
coffee
that
tastes
the
same
and
give
the
$
2
you
save
to
an
aid
agency
that
provides
food
and
education
to
poor
children
.
13 8
That
's
a
possible
strategy
,
but
there
are
advantages
to
Fairtrade
.
26 17
The
growers
know
that
they
have
to
provide
a
product
that
consumers
like
,
both
for
its
taste
and
for
the
way
it
is
grown
.
22 17
If
their
product
sells
well
,
they
can
take
pride
in
having
produced
something
that
is
sought
after
around
the
world
.
40 22
From
the
growers
'
perspective
,
receiving
a
premium
by
selling
a
Fairtrade
product
is
preferable
to
receiving
a
charitable
handout
that
they
would
get
whether
they
worked
or
not
and
regardless
of
the
quality
of
what
they
produce
.
27 11
Paying
more
for
a
Fairtrade
label
is
no
more
``
anti-market
''
than
paying
more
for
a
Gucci
label
,
and
it
reflects
better
ethical
priorities
.

Fairtrade
is
not
a
government
subsidy
.
11 7
Its
success
depends
on
market
demand
,
not
political
lobbying
.
12 6
Fortunately
,
in
Europe
,
that
market
demand
is
growing
rapidly
.
25 11
One
hopes
that
it
will
soon
reach
similar
levels
throughout
the
developed
world
,
and
wherever
people
can
make
choices
about
their
discretionary
spending
.

Pigs
,
Calves
,
and
American
Democracy
Amidst
all
the
headlines
about
the
Democrats
gaining
control
of
the
United
States
Congress
in
the
November
elections
,
one
big
election
result
was
largely
ignored
.
23 10
Although
it
illuminated
the
flaws
of
America
's
political
system
,
it
also
restored
my
belief
in
the
compassion
of
ordinary
Americans
.
24 12
In
Arizona
,
citizens
can
,
by
gathering
a
sufficient
number
of
signatures
,
put
a
proposed
law
to
a
direct
popular
vote
.
52 18
This
year
,
one
of
the
issues
on
the
ballot
was
an
act
to
prohibit
tethering
or
confining
a
pregnant
pig
,
or
a
calf
raised
for
veal
,
in
a
manner
that
prevents
the
animal
from
turning
around
freely
,
lying
down
,
and
fully
extending
his
or
her
limbs
.
17 10
Those
who
know
little
about
modern
factory
farming
may
wonder
why
such
legislation
would
be
necessary
.
33 13
Under
farming
methods
that
were
universal
50
years
ago
,
and
that
are
still
common
in
some
countries
today
,
all
animals
have
the
space
to
turn
around
and
stretch
their
limbs
.
54 19
Today
,
however
,
about
90
%
of
US
breeding
sows
--
the
mothers
of
the
pigs
that
are
raised
and
killed
for
pork
,
bacon
,
and
ham
--
spend
most
of
their
lives
locked
in
cages
that
measure
about
two
feet
by
seven
feet
-LRB-
0.6
meters
by
2.2
meters
-RRB-
.
25 13
They
are
unable
to
turn
around
,
lie
down
with
their
legs
fully
extended
,
or
move
more
than
a
step
forward
or
backward
.
14 13
Other
sows
are
kept
on
short
tethers
that
also
prevent
them
turning
around
.
29 16
Veal
calves
are
similarly
confined
for
all
their
lives
in
individual
stalls
that
do
not
permit
them
to
turn
around
,
lie
down
,
or
stretch
their
limbs
.
35 18
These
methods
are
,
essentially
,
labor-saving
devices
--
they
make
management
of
the
animals
easier
and
enable
units
with
thousands
or
tens
of
thousands
of
animals
to
employ
fewer
and
less
skilled
workers
.
17 13
They
also
prevent
the
animals
from
wasting
energy
by
moving
around
or
fighting
with
each
other
.
26 7
Several
years
ago
,
following
protests
from
animal
welfare
organizations
,
the
European
Union
commissioned
a
report
from
its
Scientific
Veterinary
Committee
on
these
methods
.
24 16
The
committee
found
that
animals
suffer
from
being
unable
to
move
freely
and
from
the
total
lack
of
anything
to
do
all
day
.
13 7
Common
sense
would
,
of
course
,
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
.
19 10
Following
the
report
,
the
EU
set
dates
by
which
close
confinement
of
these
animals
would
be
prohibited
.
16 5
For
veal
calves
,
that
date
,
January
1
,
2007
,
is
almost
here
.
24 10
Individual
stalls
for
sows
,
already
outlawed
in
the
United
Kingdom
and
Sweden
,
will
be
banned
across
the
entire
EU
from
2013
.
32 13
Measures
to
improve
the
welfare
of
laying
hens
,
which
are
typically
kept
crammed
into
bare
wire
cages
with
no
room
to
stretch
their
wings
,
are
also
being
phased
in
.
13 6
In
the
US
,
no
such
national
measures
are
anywhere
in
sight
.
31 16
In
the
past
,
when
my
European
friends
have
asked
me
why
the
US
lags
so
far
behind
Europe
in
matters
of
animal
welfare
,
I
have
had
no
answer
.
23 18
When
they
pressed
me
,
I
had
to
admit
that
the
explanation
could
be
that
Americans
care
less
about
animals
than
Europeans
.
21 12
Then
,
in
2002
,
animal
welfare
advocates
put
a
proposal
to
ban
sow
stalls
on
the
ballot
in
Florida
.
17 9
To
the
surprise
of
many
,
it
gained
the
approval
of
55
%
of
those
voting
.
29 11
Last
month
in
Arizona
,
despite
well-funded
opposition
from
agribusiness
,
the
ban
on
small
cages
for
sows
and
veal
calves
also
passed
,
with
62
%
support
.
21 9
Neither
Florida
nor
Arizona
are
particularly
progressive
states
--
both
voted
for
George
W.
Bush
over
John
Kerry
in
2004
.
32 19
So
the
results
strongly
suggest
that
if
all
Americans
were
given
a
chance
to
vote
on
keeping
pregnant
pigs
and
calves
in
such
tight
confinement
,
the
majority
would
vote
no
.
14 10
Americans
seem
to
care
just
as
much
about
animal
welfare
as
Europeans
do
.
24 10
So
,
to
explain
the
gap
between
Europe
and
the
US
on
farm
animal
welfare
,
we
should
look
to
the
political
system
.
42 16
In
Europe
,
the
concerns
of
voters
about
animal
welfare
have
been
effective
in
influencing
members
of
national
parliaments
,
as
well
as
members
of
the
European
Parliament
,
resulting
in
national
legislation
and
EU
directives
that
respond
to
those
concerns
.
19 9
In
the
US
,
by
contrast
,
similar
concerns
have
had
no
discernible
effect
on
members
of
Congress
.
22 12
There
is
no
federal
legislation
at
all
on
the
welfare
of
farm
animals
--
and
very
little
state
legislation
,
either
.
26 16
That
,
I
believe
,
is
because
agribusiness
is
able
to
put
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
into
the
pockets
of
congressional
representatives
seeking
re-election
.
26 13
The
animal
welfare
movement
,
despite
its
broad
public
support
,
has
been
unable
to
compete
in
the
arena
of
political
lobbying
and
campaign
donations
.
15 8
In
US
electoral
politics
,
money
counts
for
more
than
the
opinions
of
voters
.
34 17
Party
discipline
is
weak
,
and
Congressmen
must
themselves
raise
most
of
the
money
that
they
need
for
re-election
--
and
that
happens
every
two
years
for
members
of
the
House
of
Representatives
.
27 8
In
Europe
,
where
party
discipline
is
strong
and
the
parties
,
not
the
individual
candidates
,
finance
election
campaigns
,
money
plays
a
smaller
role
.
23 9
In
the
US
,
a
nation
that
prides
itself
on
its
democratic
traditions
,
pigs
and
calves
are
hardly
the
only
losers
.
9 6
What
's
New
About
the
New
All-Afghan
Army
?
31 13
The
murder
of
Afghanistan
's
Minister
of
Aviation
by
a
mob
-LRB-
perhaps
incited
by
members
of
Afghanistan
's
own
interim
administration
-RRB-
shows
that
Afghan
society
remains
deeply
fissured
.
14 7
The
first
reforms
to
Afghanistan
's
army
will
only
make
these
divisions
worse
.
23 10
The
Minister
of
Defense
in
Hamid
Karzai
's
temporary
administration
in
Kabul
has
already
named
the
top
officers
of
this
new
army
.
41 18
The
Minister
,
General
Mohammed
Fahim
,
is
a
Tajik
from
the
Panjshir
district
in
the
North
,
who
rose
three
months
ago
to
command
the
Northern
Alliance
forces
that
captured
Kabul
after
American
bombers
cleared
the
way
for
them
.
20 10
As
a
group
,
his
appointments
pose
a
direct
challenge
to
Mr.
Karzai
's
goal
of
reunifying
the
country
.
18 9
Afghanistan
is
a
multi-ethnic
nation
,
the
largest
group
being
Pashtuns
,
with
two-fifths
of
the
total
.
12 8
Hazaras
and
Tajiks
constitute
about
a
fifth
each
of
the
population
.
21 9
Of
thirty-eight
officers
elevated
to
general
's
rank
by
Mr.
Fahim
,
thirty-seven
are
Tajiks
,
the
other
being
Uzbek
.
30 11
If
any
of
the
country
's
fifteen
to
seventeen
million
Pashtuns
are
recruited
as
soldiers
,
they
will
serve
under
a
command
structure
made
up
almost
entirely
of
Tajiks
.
34 10
The
Pashtuns
'
language
,
however
,
is
as
different
from
Tajik
as
Spanish
is
from
English
and
millions
of
Pashtuns
of
military
age
know
only
a
smattering
of
Tajik
,
at
best
.
16 7
The
geographical
profile
of
the
new
military
leadership
is
as
narrow
as
its
ethnic
makeup
.
39 11
Thirty-five
of
the
thirty-eight
senior
officers
hail
from
one
small
area
north
of
Kabul
consisting
of
Parwan
province
-LRB-
where
the
Bagram
airport
is
located
-RRB-
and
the
nearby
Panjshir
valley
,
long
the
Northern
Alliance
's
stronghold
.
22 9
Stated
differently
,
potential
leaders
from
twenty-seven
of
Afghanistan
's
twenty-nine
provinces
were
excluded
from
their
country
's
new
military
elite
.
32 16
Perhaps
so
narrow-based
a
group
could
overcome
the
impression
that
its
members
are
a
closed
clique
if
they
represented
a
broad
cross-section
of
the
country
's
dozen
or
more
political
parties
.
7 5
But
this
is
not
the
case
.
31 15
Eighteen
of
the
thirty-eight
top
brass
come
from
one
party
,
the
Jamiat-e-Islami
,
the
Islamic
faction
that
has
long
been
led
by
mullah
and
former
theology
professor
Burhanuddin
Rabbani
.
29 20
It
was
this
party
that
ruled
Kabul
briefly
in
the
mid-1990s
,
creating
the
bloodshed
and
chaos
that
caused
most
Afghans
to
welcome
the
coming
of
the
Taliban
.
14 8
Almost
equaling
the
number
of
Jamiat
members
in
the
army
hierarchy
are
Communists
.
32 18
Sixteen
of
the
thirty-eight
have
long
been
aligned
with
this
party
,
whose
ploys
in
the
late
1970s
led
to
the
Soviet
invasion
of
1979-89
which
cost
two-and-a-half
million
Afghan
lives
.
23 10
Most
Afghans
today
view
the
Communists
with
the
same
degree
of
sympathy
that
Czechs
or
Poles
reserve
for
Hitler
's
National
Socialists
.
28 10
True
,
people
in
Afghanistan
,
as
elsewhere
,
joined
the
Communist
Party
for
various
reasons
,
and
by
no
means
were
all
of
them
hard-core
ideologues
.
30 11
But
in
the
case
of
General
Fahim
's
generals
,
six
were
professional
Communist
Party
workers
,
and
continued
to
serve
the
Party
after
the
Red
Army
's
invasion
.
30 10
All
six
of
these
men
,
plus
three
more
Communists
who
served
as
officers
in
the
Afghan
army
,
collaborated
actively
during
the
Soviet
's
decade-long
occupation
of
Afghanistan
.
30 17
Imagine
how
the
French
would
have
reacted
if
a
quarter
of
France
's
post-World
War
II
officer
corps
had
sided
with
the
Wehrmacht
during
its
occupation
of
their
country
.
10 8
In
Afghanistan
news
travels
quickly
by
word
of
mouth
.
31 11
Afghan
nationalists
-LRB-
which
includes
nearly
all
Afghans
-RRB-
will
soon
discover
the
political
backgrounds
of
members
of
General
Fahim
's
inner
circle
,
if
they
do
n't
know
already
.
42 14
Even
this
overwhelming
evidence
of
one-sidedness
and
bias
in
the
formation
of
the
new
army
's
high
command
could
be
neutralized
if
the
generals
brought
professionalism
and
commitment
to
the
patriotic
values
of
a
truly
national
armed
forces
to
their
work
.
18 9
Unfortunately
,
only
ten
of
the
thirty-eight
brass
promoted
by
Fahim
have
backgrounds
as
professional
military
officers
.
7 6
An
eleventh
served
as
a
pilot
.
41 9
By
contrast
,
twenty-four
of
the
total
-LRB-
the
backgrounds
of
the
remaining
four
are
unknown
-RRB-
come
from
civilian
life
,
whether
the
professions
,
Communist
Party
offices
,
or
in
one
case
,
a
career
as
a
mullah
.
12 9
What
do
all
these
statistics
mean
in
terms
of
day-to-day
reality
?
59 18
They
mean
that
when
the
commanders
of
the
international
peacekeeping
forces
in
Afghanistan
,
as
well
as
American
military
and
diplomatic
officials
,
meet
Afghanistan
's
Deputy
Minister
of
Defense
they
will
encounter
Abdul
Rashid
Dostum
,
a
notoriously
brutal
and
corrupt
warlord
and
Communist
who
keeps
in
touch
with
old
Red
Army
friends
still
serving
in
Moscow
.
40 16
It
means
that
the
Chief
of
the
Afghan
Armed
Forces
,
as
well
as
the
Chief
of
Operations
and
the
Chief
of
Army
Intelligence
are
also
Communists
,
men
whose
loyalties
remain
uncertain
and
are
distrusted
by
most
Afghans
.
11 7
Is
this
a
team
likely
to
bring
war-torn
Afghanistan
together
?
31 14
Is
the
presence
in
Kabul
of
so
dubious
a
crew
likely
to
instill
confidence
in
the
three-quarters
of
Afghanistan
's
population
who
are
shut
out
of
the
top
army
command
?
42 19
Or
is
this
list
,
rather
,
the
harvest
of
a
``
winner-take-all
''
approach
to
governance
that
is
bound
-LRB-
at
some
future
point
-RRB-
to
unleash
another
bloody
national
backlash
by
those
whose
legitimate
interests
have
been
cynically
trampled
?
28 14
UN
,
European
,
and
American
policymakers
should
ponder
these
questions
before
allowing
themselves
to
acquiesce
in
a
ruthless
power
grab
by
a
small
and
unpopular
minority
.
29 10
Celebrating
the
Irrational
Three
cheers
for
the
new
Nobel
laureates
in
economics
:
Daniel
Kahneman
of
Princeton
University
,
and
Vernon
Smith
of
George
Mason
University
in
Virginia
.
30 14
Like
many
Nobel
prizes
,
these
awards
recognize
not
only
the
seminal
work
undertaken
by
Kahneman
and
Smith
,
but
also
the
schools
of
thought
they
help
to
lead
.
22 14
Kahneman
,
a
psychologist
,
has
demonstrated
how
individuals
systematically
behave
in
ways
less
rational
than
orthodox
economists
believe
they
do
.
46 14
His
research
shows
not
only
that
individuals
sometimes
act
differently
than
standard
economic
theories
predict
,
but
that
they
do
so
regularly
,
systematically
,
and
in
ways
that
can
be
understood
and
interpreted
through
alternative
hypotheses
,
competing
with
those
utilized
by
orthodox
economists
.
19 8
To
most
market
participants
-
and
indeed
,
ordinary
observers
--
this
does
not
seem
like
big
news
.
20 12
Wall
Street
brokers
who
peddled
stocks
they
knew
to
be
garbage
exploited
the
irrationality
that
Kahneman
and
Smith
exposed
.
17 11
Much
of
the
mania
that
led
to
the
bubble
economy
was
based
on
exploiting
investor
psychology
.
14 6
In
fact
,
this
irrationality
is
no
news
to
the
economics
profession
either
.
42 22
John
Maynard
Keynes
long
ago
described
the
stock
market
as
based
not
on
rational
individuals
struggling
to
uncover
market
fundamentals
,
but
as
a
beauty
contest
in
which
the
winner
is
the
one
who
guesses
best
what
the
judges
will
say
.
32 14
This
year
's
Nobel
prize
celebrates
a
critique
of
simplistic
market
economics
,
just
as
last
year
's
award
-LRB-
of
which
I
was
one
of
the
three
winners
-RRB-
did
.
31 11
Last
year
's
laureates
emphasized
that
different
market
participants
have
different
-LRB-
and
imperfect
-RRB-
information
,
and
these
asymmetries
in
information
have
profound
impact
on
how
an
economy
functions
.
29 12
In
particular
,
last
year
's
laureates
implied
that
markets
were
not
,
in
general
,
efficient
;
that
there
was
an
important
role
for
government
to
play
.
33 12
Adam
Smith
's
invisible
hand
--
the
idea
that
free
markets
lead
to
efficiency
as
if
by
an
invisible
hand
--
is
invisible
at
least
in
part
because
it
is
not
there
.
33 19
This
,
too
,
is
not
news
to
those
who
work
day
after
day
in
the
market
-LRB-
and
make
their
fortunes
by
taking
advantage
of
and
overcoming
asymmetries
in
information
-RRB-
.
67 23
For
more
than
twenty
years
economists
were
enthralled
to
so
called
``
rational
expectations
''
models
which
assumed
that
all
participants
have
the
same
-LRB-
if
not
perfect
-RRB-
information
and
act
perfectly
rationally
,
that
markets
are
perfectly
efficient
,
that
unemployment
never
exists
-LRB-
except
when
caused
by
greedy
unions
or
government
minimum
wages
-RRB-
,
and
where
there
is
never
any
credit
rationing
.
27 10
That
such
models
prevailed
,
especially
in
America
's
graduate
schools
,
despite
evidence
to
the
contrary
bears
testimony
to
a
triumph
of
ideology
over
science
.
34 21
Unfortunately
,
students
of
these
graduate
programs
now
act
as
policymakers
in
many
countries
,
and
are
trying
to
implement
programs
based
on
the
ideas
that
have
come
to
be
called
market
fundamentalism
.
33 15
Let
me
be
clear
:
the
rational
expectations
models
made
an
important
contribution
to
economics
;
the
rigor
which
its
supporters
imposed
on
economic
thinking
helped
expose
the
weaknesses
many
underlying
hypotheses
.
19 7
Good
science
recognizes
its
limitations
,
but
the
prophets
of
rational
expectations
have
usually
shown
no
such
modesty
.
25 16
Vernon
Smith
is
a
leader
in
the
development
of
experimental
economics
,
the
idea
that
one
could
test
many
economic
propositions
in
laboratory
settings
.
29 11
One
reason
that
economics
is
such
a
difficult
subject
,
and
why
there
are
so
many
disagreements
among
economists
,
is
that
economists
can
not
conduct
controlled
experiments
.
28 17
Nature
throws
up
natural
experiments
,
but
in
most
circumstances
,
so
many
things
change
so
rapidly
that
it
is
often
difficult
to
untangle
what
caused
what
.
20 8
In
principle
,
in
a
laboratory
,
we
can
conduct
controlled
experiments
,
and
therefore
make
more
reliable
inferences
.
42 17
Critics
of
experimental
economics
worry
that
subjects
bring
to
experimental
situations
modes
of
thought
determined
outside
of
the
experiment
,
and
thus
that
the
experiments
are
not
as
clean
and
the
inferences
not
as
clear
cut
as
in
the
physical
sciences
.
21 10
Nonetheless
,
economic
experiments
provide
insights
into
a
number
of
important
issues
,
such
as
the
improved
design
of
auctions
.
26 11
Most
importantly
,
the
irrationality
of
market
participants
,
which
was
the
focus
of
Kahneman
's
work
,
has
been
verified
repeatedly
in
laboratory
contexts
.
19 11
Among
the
more
amusing
results
that
have
come
out
of
experimental
economics
are
those
concerning
altruism
and
selfishness
.
30 15
It
appears
-LRB-
at
least
in
experimental
situations
-RRB-
that
experimental
subjects
are
not
as
selfish
as
economists
have
hypothesized
--
except
for
one
group
-
the
economists
themselves
.
29 15
Is
it
because
economics
as
a
discipline
attracts
individuals
who
are
by
nature
more
selfish
or
is
it
because
economics
helps
shape
individuals
,
making
them
more
selfish
?
13 7
The
answer
,
almost
certainly
,
is
a
little
bit
of
both
.
19 11
Presumably
,
future
experimental
research
will
help
resolve
the
question
of
the
relative
importance
of
these
two
hypotheses
.
25 14
The
Nobel
Prize
signifies
how
important
it
is
to
study
people
and
economies
as
they
are
,
not
as
we
want
them
to
be
.
23 13
Only
by
understanding
better
actual
human
behavior
can
we
hope
to
design
policies
that
will
make
our
economies
work
better
as
well
.
63 16
Bush
's
Bad-Faith
Energy
Policy
One
of
the
more
surreal
sessions
at
this
year
's
World
Economic
Forum
in
Davos
had
oil
industry
experts
explaining
how
the
melting
of
the
polar
ice
cap
--
which
is
occurring
faster
than
anyone
anticipated
-
--
represents
not
only
a
problem
,
but
also
an
opportunity
:
vast
amounts
of
oil
may
now
be
accessible
.
44 22
Similarly
,
these
experts
concede
that
the
fact
that
the
United
States
has
not
signed
the
Law
of
the
Sea
,
the
international
convention
determining
who
has
access
to
offshore
oil
and
other
maritime
mineral
rights
,
presents
a
risk
of
international
conflict
.
31 9
But
they
also
point
to
the
upside
:
the
oil
industry
,
in
its
never-ending
search
for
more
reserves
,
need
not
beg
Congress
for
the
right
to
despoil
Alaska
.
15 9
President
George
W.
Bush
has
an
uncanny
ability
not
to
see
the
big
message
.
17 11
For
years
,
it
has
become
increasingly
clear
that
much
is
amiss
with
his
energy
policy
.
28 10
Scripted
by
the
oil
industry
,
even
members
of
his
own
party
referred
to
an
earlier
energy
bill
as
one
that
``
left
no
lobbyist
behind
.
''
32 13
While
praising
the
virtues
of
the
free
market
,
Bush
has
been
only
too
willing
to
give
huge
handouts
to
the
energy
industry
,
even
as
the
country
faces
soaring
deficits
.
29 13
There
is
a
market
failure
when
it
comes
to
energy
,
but
government
intervention
should
run
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction
from
what
the
Bush
administration
has
proposed
.
40 15
The
fact
that
Americans
do
not
pay
the
full
price
for
the
pollution
--
especially
enormous
contributions
to
greenhouse
gases
--
that
results
from
their
profligate
energy
use
means
that
energy
is
under-priced
,
in
turn
sustaining
excessive
consumption
.
30 10
The
government
needs
to
encourage
conservation
,
and
intervening
in
the
price
system
-
--
namely
,
through
taxes
on
energy
--
is
an
efficient
way
to
do
it
.
30 15
But
,
rather
than
encouraging
conservation
,
Bush
has
pursued
a
policy
of
``
drain
America
first
,
''
leaving
America
more
dependent
on
external
oil
in
the
future
.
27 13
Never
mind
that
high
demand
drives
up
oil
prices
,
creating
a
windfall
for
many
in
the
Middle
East
who
are
not
among
America
's
friends
.
46 14
Now
,
more
than
four
years
after
the
terrorist
attacks
of
September
2001
,
Bush
appears
to
have
finally
woken
up
to
the
reality
of
America
's
increasing
dependence
;
with
soaring
oil
prices
,
it
was
hard
for
him
not
to
note
the
consequences
.
20 7
But
,
again
,
his
administration
's
faltering
moves
will
almost
surely
make
matters
worse
in
the
immediate
future
.
26 13
Bush
still
refuses
to
do
anything
about
conservation
,
and
he
has
put
very
little
money
behind
his
continuing
prayer
than
technology
will
save
us
.
30 14
What
,
then
,
to
make
of
Bush
's
recent
declaration
of
a
commitment
to
make
America
75
%
free
of
dependence
on
Middle
East
oil
within
25
years
.
33 20
For
investors
,
the
message
is
clear
:
do
not
invest
more
in
developing
reserves
in
the
Middle
East
,
which
is
by
far
the
lowest-cost
source
of
oil
in
the
world
.
31 9
But
,
without
new
investment
in
developing
Middle
East
reserves
,
unbridled
growth
of
energy
consumption
in
the
US
,
China
,
and
elsewhere
implies
that
demand
will
outpace
supply
.
29 9
If
that
were
not
enough
,
Bush
's
threat
of
sanctions
against
Iran
poses
the
risks
of
interruptions
of
supplies
from
one
of
the
world
's
largest
producers
.
45 11
With
world
oil
production
close
to
full
capacity
and
prices
already
more
than
double
their
pre-Iraq
War
level
,
this
portends
still
higher
prices
,
and
still
higher
profits
for
the
oil
industry
--
the
only
clear
winner
in
Bush
's
Middle
East
policy
.
20 13
To
be
sure
,
one
should
n't
begrudge
Bush
for
having
at
last
recognized
that
there
is
a
problem
.
22 8
But
,
as
always
,
a
closer
look
at
what
he
is
proposing
suggests
another
sleight
of
hand
by
his
administration
.
45 14
Aside
from
refusing
to
recognize
the
importance
of
global
warming
,
encourage
conservation
,
or
devote
enough
funds
to
research
to
make
a
real
difference
,
Bush
's
grandiose
promise
of
a
reduction
of
dependence
on
Middle
East
oil
means
less
than
it
appears
.
26 10
With
only
20
%
of
US
oil
coming
from
the
Middle
East
,
his
goal
could
be
achieved
by
a
modest
shift
of
sourcing
elsewhere
.
20 7
But
surely
,
one
would
think
,
the
Bush
administration
must
realize
that
oil
trades
on
a
global
market
.
35 10
Even
if
America
were
100
%
independent
of
Middle
East
oil
,
a
reduction
in
supply
of
Middle
East
oil
could
have
devastating
effects
on
the
world
price
--
and
on
the
American
economy
.
20 9
As
is
too
often
the
case
with
the
Bush
administration
,
there
is
no
flattering
explanation
of
official
policy
.
14 11
Is
Bush
playing
politics
by
pandering
to
anti-Arab
and
anti-Iranian
sentiment
in
America
?
11 6
Or
is
this
just
another
example
of
incompetence
and
muddle
?
26 10
From
what
we
have
seen
over
the
past
five
years
,
the
correct
answer
probably
contains
more
than
a
little
bad
faith
and
sheer
ineptitude
.
43 16
China
's
Roadmap
China
is
about
to
adopt
its
11th
five-year
plan
,
setting
the
stage
for
the
continuation
of
probably
the
most
remarkable
economic
transformation
in
history
,
while
improving
the
well-being
of
almost
a
quarter
of
the
world
's
population
.
20 10
Never
before
has
the
world
seen
such
sustained
growth
;
never
before
has
there
been
so
much
poverty
reduction
.
20 9
Part
of
the
key
to
China
's
long-run
success
has
been
its
almost
unique
combination
of
pragmatism
and
vision
.
45 12
While
much
of
the
rest
of
the
developing
world
,
following
the
Washington
Consensus
,
has
been
directed
at
a
quixotic
quest
for
higher
GDP
,
China
has
once
again
made
clear
that
it
seeks
sustainable
and
more
equitable
increases
in
real
living
standards
.
24 15
China
realizes
that
it
has
entered
a
phase
of
economic
growth
that
is
imposing
enormous
--
and
unsustainable
--
demands
on
the
environment
.
15 9
Unless
there
is
a
change
in
course
,
living
standards
will
eventually
be
compromised
.
14 9
That
is
why
the
new
five-year
plan
places
great
emphasis
on
the
environment
.
39 14
Even
many
of
the
more
backward
parts
of
China
have
been
growing
at
a
pace
that
would
be
a
marvel
,
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
other
parts
of
the
country
are
growing
even
more
rapidly
.
28 12
While
this
has
reduced
poverty
,
inequality
has
been
increasing
,
with
growing
disparities
between
cities
and
rural
areas
,
and
between
coastal
regions
and
the
interior
.
32 10
This
year
's
World
Bank
World
Development
Report
explains
why
inequality
,
not
just
poverty
,
should
be
a
concern
,
and
China
's
11th
five-year
plan
attacks
the
problem
head-on
.
23 9
The
government
has
for
several
years
talked
about
a
more
harmonious
society
,
and
the
plan
describes
ambitious
programs
for
achieving
this
.
29 14
China
recognizes
,
too
,
that
what
separates
less
developed
from
more
developed
countries
is
not
only
a
gap
in
resources
,
but
also
a
gap
in
knowledge
.
23 12
So
it
has
laid
out
bold
plans
not
only
to
reduce
that
gap
,
but
to
create
a
basis
for
independent
innovation
.
22 9
China
's
role
in
the
world
and
the
world
's
economy
has
changed
,
and
the
plan
reflects
this
,
too
.
23 17
Its
future
growth
will
have
to
be
based
more
on
domestic
demand
than
on
exports
,
which
will
require
increases
in
consumption
.
11 6
Indeed
,
China
has
a
rare
problem
:
excessive
savings
.
40 10
People
save
partly
because
of
weaknesses
in
government
social-insurance
programs
;
strengthening
social
security
-LRB-
pensions
-RRB-
and
public
health
and
education
will
simultaneously
reduce
social
inequalities
,
increase
citizens
'
sense
of
well-being
,
and
promote
current
consumption
.
43 14
If
successful
--
and
,
so
far
,
China
has
almost
always
surpassed
even
its
own
high
expectations
--
these
adjustments
may
impose
enormous
strains
on
a
global
economic
system
that
is
already
unbalanced
by
America
's
huge
fiscal
and
trade
imbalances
.
39 13
If
China
saves
less
--
and
if
,
as
officials
have
announced
,
it
pursues
a
more
diversified
policy
of
investing
its
reserves
--
who
will
finance
America
's
more
than
$
2
billion
a
day
trade
deficit
?
17 8
This
is
a
topic
for
another
day
,
but
that
day
may
not
be
far
off
.
15 7
With
such
a
clear
vision
of
the
future
,
the
challenge
will
be
implementation
.
19 13
China
is
a
large
country
,
and
it
could
not
have
succeeded
as
it
has
without
widespread
decentralization
.
8 7
But
decentralization
raises
problems
of
its
own
.
10 6
Greenhouse
gases
,
for
example
,
are
global
problems
.
23 15
While
America
says
that
it
can
not
afford
to
do
anything
about
it
,
China
's
senior
officials
have
acted
more
responsibly
.
40 13
Within
a
month
of
the
adoption
of
the
plan
,
new
environmental
taxes
on
cars
,
gasoline
,
and
wood
products
were
imposed
:
China
was
using
market
based
mechanisms
to
address
its
and
the
world
's
environmental
problems
.
17 8
But
the
pressures
on
local
government
officials
to
deliver
economic
growth
and
jobs
will
be
enormous
.
27 22
They
will
be
sorely
tempted
to
argue
that
if
America
can
not
afford
to
produce
in
a
way
that
preserves
our
planet
,
how
can
we
?
23 9
To
translate
its
vision
into
action
,
the
Chinese
government
will
need
strong
policies
,
such
as
the
environmental
taxes
already
imposed
.
37 21
As
China
has
moved
toward
a
market
economy
,
it
has
developed
some
of
the
problems
that
have
plagued
the
developed
countries
:
special
interests
that
clothe
self-serving
arguments
behind
a
thin
veil
of
market
ideology
.
21 9
Some
will
argue
for
trickle-down
economics
:
do
n't
worry
about
the
poor
,
eventually
everybody
will
benefit
from
growth
.
19 9
And
some
will
oppose
competition
policy
and
strong
corporate
governance
laws
:
let
Darwinian
survival
work
its
wonders
.
27 11
Growth
arguments
will
be
advanced
to
counter
strong
social
and
environmental
policies
:
higher
gasoline
taxes
,
for
example
,
will
kill
our
nascent
auto
industry
.
23 10
Such
allegedly
pro-growth
policies
would
not
only
fail
to
deliver
growth
;
they
would
threaten
the
entire
vision
of
China
's
future
.
33 16
There
is
only
one
way
to
prevent
this
:
open
discussion
of
economic
policies
in
order
to
expose
fallacies
and
provide
scope
for
creative
solutions
to
the
many
challenges
facing
China
today
.
20 9
George
W.
Bush
has
shown
the
dangers
of
excessive
secrecy
and
confining
decision-making
to
a
narrow
circle
of
sycophants
.
42 15
Most
people
outside
China
do
not
fully
appreciate
the
extent
to
which
its
leaders
,
by
contrast
,
have
engaged
in
extensive
deliberations
and
broad
consultations
-LRB-
even
with
foreigners
-RRB-
as
they
strive
to
solve
the
enormous
problems
they
face
.
6 5
Market
economies
are
not
self-regulating
.
22 17
They
can
not
simply
be
left
on
autopilot
,
especially
if
one
wants
to
ensure
that
their
benefits
are
shared
widely
.
10 6
But
managing
a
market
economy
is
no
easy
task
.
13 11
It
is
a
balancing
act
that
must
constantly
respond
to
economic
changes
.
12 7
China
's
11th
five-year
plan
provides
a
roadmap
for
that
response
.
21 12
The
world
watches
in
awe
,
and
hope
,
as
the
lives
of
1.3
billion
people
continue
to
be
transformed

Tocqueville
's
Lessons
in
Democracy
It
seems
appropriate
that
,
due
to
the
Iraq
war
,
the
world
has
been
debating
the
nature
of
democracy
200
years
after
Alexis
de
Tocqueville
's
birth
.
28 12
Tocqueville
is
justly
famous
for
rejecting
reactionary
nostalgia
and
regarding
democracy
's
triumph
as
our
destiny
,
while
warning
against
the
dangers
that
democracy
holds
for
liberty
.
7 5
Should
we
still
share
his
worries
?
37 12
Tocqueville
viewed
democracy
not
only
as
a
political
regime
,
but
,
above
all
,
as
an
intellectual
regime
that
shapes
a
society
's
customs
in
general
,
thereby
giving
it
a
sociological
and
psychological
dimension
.
15 6
Democratic
regimes
,
Tocqueville
argued
,
determine
our
thoughts
,
desires
,
and
passions
.
27 10
Just
as
there
was
Renaissance
man
and
,
in
the
twentieth
century
,
homo
sovieticus
,
``
democratic
man
''
is
a
form
of
human
being
.
17 10
For
Tocqueville
,
democracy
's
systemic
effects
could
lead
citizens
to
deprive
themselves
of
reasoned
thought
.
29 11
They
could
only
pretend
to
judge
events
and
values
on
their
own
;
in
reality
,
they
would
merely
copy
the
rough
and
simplified
opinions
of
the
masses
.
34 15
Indeed
,
what
Tocqueville
called
the
hold
of
``
social
power
''
on
opinion
is
probably
strongest
in
democratic
regimes
--
a
view
that
foretells
the
growth
of
modern-day
demagogy
and
media
manipulation
.
13 10
Tocqueville
believed
that
there
are
no
effective
long-term
constraints
on
this
tendency
.
29 11
Neither
local
democracy
nor
small
societies
,
neither
governmental
checks
and
balances
nor
civil
rights
,
can
prevent
the
decline
of
critical
thought
that
democracy
seems
to
cause
.
23 16
Schools
have
the
power
to
be
little
more
than
enclaves
from
the
corrosive
strength
of
social
influences
on
how
the
mind
works
.
40 14
Similarly
,
while
Tocqueville
thought
that
pursuing
virtue
as
the
ancients
did
,
or
having
a
religious
faith
,
could
sometimes
elevate
the
soul
,
both
conflict
with
the
democratic
ideal
if
they
become
officially
prescribed
in
public
life
.
37 13
In
this
sense
,
Tocqueville
's
intellectual
heirs
include
the
neo-Marxist
theorists
of
the
Frankfurt
School
,
as
well
as
Hannah
Arendt
,
all
of
whom
feared
above
all
the
disintegration
of
reason
in
modern
societies
.
15 7
Indeed
,
the
French
philosopher
Marcel
Gauchet
entitled
a
recent
book
Democracy
Against
Itself
.
35 15
The
democratic
way
of
life
,
these
writers
argue
,
tends
to
destroy
original
thought
and
to
suppress
``
high
''
culture
,
yielding
a
mediocrity
that
leaves
citizens
vulnerable
to
democracy
's
enemies
.
36 12
But
,
while
history
is
replete
with
murderous
regimes
applauded
by
cowed
and
deceived
masses
,
the
greater
risk
for
democratic
nations
is
that
their
citizens
withdraw
into
apathy
and
short-term
thinking
for
immediate
gratification
.
24 14
The
past
--
despite
rituals
that
seek
to
commemorate
historic
moments
--
is
obliterated
by
an
addiction
to
the
now
and
the
new
.
12 7
Even
the
supposedly
well-educated
ruling
class
is
subject
to
this
bewitchment
.
14 7
The
essential
problem
of
the
democratic
mind
is
its
lack
of
historical
consciousness
.
28 16
Do
the
defects
of
democracy
really
mean
,
as
Tocqueville
claimed
,
that
resigned
pessimism
is
the
only
--
realistic
but
unsustainable
--
path
open
to
us
?
6 6
I
do
n't
think
so
.
18 16
There
are
means
to
fight
against
what
might
be
called
today
's
growing
``
democratic
stupidity
.
''
33 19
The
first
defense
is
to
push
for
an
educational
system
that
really
forms
critical
minds
,
namely
through
the
-LRB-
nowadays
-RRB-
largely
neglected
subjects
of
literature
,
history
,
and
philosophy
.
34 12
If
the
informed
and
critical
citizenry
that
democracy
requires
is
to
be
formed
,
our
schools
must
stop
pandering
to
the
latest
popular
fads
and
begin
to
sharpen
the
analytical
capacities
of
students
.
21 10
The
biggest
impediment
to
such
an
education
are
the
mass
media
,
with
its
tendency
to
cultivate
superficiality
and
amusement
.
16 11
Many
people
nowadays
spend
more
of
their
lives
watching
television
than
they
do
in
classrooms
.
19 7
The
passivity
that
mass
media
encourages
is
the
polar
opposite
of
the
active
engagement
that
democratic
citizens
need
.
35 20
But
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
the
mass
media
-LRB-
other
than
quality
newspapers
-RRB-
would
,
of
their
own
volition
,
become
instruments
of
an
education
that
enhances
citizens
'
critical
capacities
.
14 10
This
concern
about
mass
media
is
no
mere
elitist
scorn
for
popular
culture
.
43 13
The
question
is
not
one
of
popularity
alone
--
after
all
,
Mozart
was
popular
in
his
day
,
and
Shakespeare
's
plays
attracted
the
poor
as
well
as
the
rich
--
but
of
mass
culture
's
refusal
to
challenge
and
provoke
.
14 7
The
result
of
the
failure
is
a
generalized
indifference
and
passivity
in
audiences
.
31 13
Indeed
,
for
a
long
time
a
globalized
media
culture
,
one
unable
to
inspire
the
capacity
for
critical
thought
or
create
elevated
feelings
,
has
been
on
the
rise
.
32 17
It
is
a
culture
that
,
through
its
carelessness
,
threatens
democratic
freedom
because
it
fails
to
create
any
sense
of
obligation
--
to
society
,
to
history
,
to
community
.
16 12
Is
it
too
late
to
do
anything
about
a
culture
that
so
deadens
the
spirit
?
21 10
Tocqueville
despised
the
elites
of
his
time
for
their
complacency
in
the
face
of
the
deracinating
force
of
mass
democracy
.
16 8
Will
the
myopia
of
our
leaders
also
serve
as
an
agent
of
his
disquieting
prophecy
?
33 10
A
Europe
for
All
Longtime
members
of
the
European
Union
now
seem
to
doubt
the
Union
's
future
,
but
we
in
Ukraine
look
at
the
European
Union
with
hope
and
admiration
.
31 13
To
join
in
the
EU
's
progress
is
the
basic
object
of
our
foreign
policy
,
for
Ukraine
has
discovered
that
nationhood
is
not
an
end
,
but
a
beginning
.
18 8
Indeed
,
European
unity
is
indivisible
:
when
one
nation
is
ostracized
,
all
are
not
free
.
17 12
We
Europeans
are
caught
in
an
inescapable
net
,
tied
in
a
single
garment
of
destiny
.
21 9
Every
aspect
of
our
shared
culture
,
if
not
the
last
century
of
shared
suffering
,
confirms
that
for
us
.
10 7
Whatever
affects
one
European
directly
,
affects
all
indirectly
.
25 15
Never
again
can
we
afford
to
live
with
the
narrow
notion
of
two
Europes
,
of
haves
and
have-nots
,
of
insiders
and
outsiders
.
23 9
Anyone
who
lives
within
the
European
continent
can
not
--
indeed
,
must
not
--
be
considered
a
stranger
to
its
Union
.
14 6
Today
's
great
Pax
Europa
and
today
's
pan-European
prosperity
depend
on
this
.
12 8
Of
course
,
some
people
mutter
that
Ukraine
is
not
Europe
.
48 20
Let
them
come
to
Kyiv
and
speak
to
the
people
,
young
and
old
,
factory
worker
,
farmer
's
wife
,
the
lawyers
and
doctors
and
teachers
who
stood
and
stayed
in
the
cold
and
snow
for
weeks
on
end
last
winter
to
defend
their
freedoms
.
17 11
Are
they
not
united
with
those
who
stood
alongside
General
de
Gaulle
in
the
French
Resistance
?
35 23
Are
they
not
one
with
those
who
died
fighting
for
the
Spanish
Republic
in
the
1930
's
,
who
liberated
Budapest
in
1956
and
ended
fascism
in
Spain
and
Portugal
in
the
1970
's
?
25 13
Are
they
not
animated
by
the
same
spirit
as
Poland
's
Solidarity
and
the
peaceful
masses
that
created
Prague
's
Velvet
Revolution
in
1989
?
14 7
That
is
the
true
European
spirit
,
and
no
doubts
can
crush
it
.
45 17
To
those
who
say
that
Ukraine
is
too
backward
for
EU
membership
,
I
say
:
Let
them
,
too
,
come
to
my
country
and
see
the
mothers
who
stay
late
at
night
at
work
teaching
their
children
to
use
their
workplace
computer
.
28 14
Let
them
come
to
the
language
classes
in
every
village
and
city
where
young
people
are
readying
themselves
for
Europe
by
learning
French
and
German
and
English
.
33 12
Those
who
doubt
Ukraine
's
European
vocation
should
understand
that
Europe
is
not
a
matter
of
hardware
and
superhighways
;
it
is
the
unquenchable
desire
for
freedom
,
prosperity
,
and
solidarity
.
45 18
I
believe
that
our
future
is
as
promising
as
Europe
's
past
is
proud
,
and
that
our
destiny
lies
not
as
a
forgotten
borderland
on
a
troubled
region
,
but
as
a
maker
and
shaper
of
Europe
's
peace
and
Europe
's
unity
.
24 12
Self-determination
no
longer
means
isolation
,
because
achieving
national
independence
nowadays
means
only
to
return
to
the
world
scene
with
a
new
status
.
29 14
New
nations
can
build
with
their
former
occupiers
the
same
kind
of
fruitful
relationship
that
France
established
with
Germany
--
a
relationship
founded
on
equality
and
mutual
interests
.
29 14
That
is
the
type
of
relationship
that
my
government
seeks
with
Russia
,
and
achieving
it
is
how
we
can
help
extend
the
zone
of
Europe
's
peace
.
24 17
Of
course
,
it
is
premature
to
do
more
than
indicate
the
high
regard
with
which
we
view
the
prospect
of
EU
membership
.
15 10
We
know
that
our
part
in
that
great
edifice
will
not
be
built
overnight
.
33 15
We
know
that
the
great
works
of
European
unification
lay
not
in
documents
and
declarations
,
but
in
innovative
action
designed
to
better
the
lives
and
insure
the
security
of
all
Europeans
.
17 8
Building
a
Ukraine
worthy
of
EU
membership
will
not
be
easy
,
cheap
,
or
fast
.
17 7
But
,
like
the
Union
itself
,
it
will
be
built
and
it
will
be
done
.
25 11
We
know
the
challenge
is
great
,
but
the
prize
is
worth
the
struggle
,
and
Europe
should
know
that
this
is
our
goal
.
37 20
Part
of
the
work
of
renewing
Ukraine
is
a
creative
battle
to
put
an
end
to
a
nightmarish
century
during
which
fascism
and
communism
--
ideologies
born
in
the
heart
of
Europe
--
battled
for
mastery
.
27 8
Only
a
few
months
ago
,
in
cities
throughout
Ukraine
,
our
children
and
our
parents
confronted
armed
troops
,
snarling
dogs
,
and
even
death
.
35 13
Only
a
few
years
ago
,
a
young
journalist
,
Georgi
Gongadze
,
seeking
to
inform
the
public
about
our
old
regime
's
corruption
,
was
brutalized
and
beheaded
by
that
regime
's
thugs
.
13 8
But
our
Orange
Revolution
last
winter
shows
that
Ukraine
's
people
prevailed
.
17 7
So
,
despite
today
's
doubts
and
difficulties
,
I
retain
an
abiding
faith
in
Europe
.
19 12
I
refuse
to
accept
despair
as
the
final
response
to
the
ambiguities
and
horrors
of
Ukraine
's
history
.
35 21
I
refuse
to
accept
the
view
that
Ukraine
is
so
tragically
bound
to
the
starless
midnight
of
communism
's
legacy
that
we
can
never
see
the
bright
daybreak
of
peace
and
true
European
unity
.
26 11
When
the
EU
's
citizens
ponder
Ukraine
's
place
in
Europe
,
they
should
look
both
beyond
and
more
closely
at
the
face
they
see
.
31 15
They
should
look
beyond
the
ravaged
wastelands
that
communism
inflicted
,
beyond
the
poverty
,
and
beyond
the
social
divisions
through
which
our
discarded
ex-leaders
sought
to
prolong
their
misrule
.
52 18
Instead
,
they
should
look
closely
at
the
face
of
our
president
,
Viktor
Yushchenko
,
ravaged
by
poison
during
last
year
's
election
campaign
,
and
recall
the
words
of
the
great
Frenchman
André
Malraux
,
for
whom
``
the
most
beautiful
faces
are
those
that
have
been
wounded
.
''
23 12
The
Muslim
Civil
War
Is
the
Sunni-Shia
divide
in
the
Middle
East
now
deeper
than
the
antagonism
between
Israel
and
the
Arabs
?
19 15
You
might
think
so
given
the
response
of
some
Arab
governments
to
Hezbollah
's
decision
to
attack
Israel
.
37 9
Even
as
Israeli
bombs
fell
on
Beirut
and
Tyre
,
Saudi
Arabia
,
perhaps
the
most
conservative
Arab
Muslim
state
of
all
,
openly
condemned
the
actions
of
the
Shia
Hezbollah
in
instigating
conflict
with
Israel
.
27 9
Never
before
in
the
history
of
the
Arab-Israeli
conflict
has
a
state
that
considers
itself
a
leader
of
the
Arab
Muslim
peoples
backed
Israel
so
openly
.
14 6
Moreover
,
Saudi
Arabia
's
breach
with
Hezbollah
is
not
a
one-time
occurrence
.
20 9
Egypt
and
Jordan
have
also
roundly
condemned
Hezbollah
and
its
leader
,
Sheik
Hassan
Nasrallah
,
for
their
adventurism
.
7 6
What
is
behind
this
stunning
development
?
15 9
Are
we
seeing
a
fundamental
shift
in
relations
between
Arab
nationalism
and
Islamic
sectarianism
?
25 12
Is
Saudi
Arabia
's
Sunni
government
more
concerned
and
frightened
by
Shia
Islam
than
it
is
committed
to
Arab
unity
and
the
Palestinian
cause
?
29 12
Arab
denunciations
of
Hezbollah
suggest
that
the
Muslim
sectarian
divide
,
already
evident
in
the
daily
violence
in
Iraq
,
is
deepening
and
intensifying
across
the
Middle
East
.
32 12
President
George
W.
Bush
's
desire
to
shatter
the
Arab
world
's
frozen
societies
was
meant
to
pit
the
forces
of
modernization
against
the
traditional
elements
in
Arab
and
Islamic
societies
.
14 11
Instead
,
he
appears
to
have
unleashed
the
region
's
most
atavistic
forces
.
32 14
Opening
this
Pandora
's
Box
may
have
ushered
in
a
new
and
even
uglier
era
of
generalized
violence
,
perhaps
what
can
only
be
called
a
``
Muslim
Civil
War
.
''
42 10
The
Shia-Sunni
divide
has
existed
from
the
dawn
of
Islam
,
but
the
geographical
and
ethnic
isolation
of
non-Arab
Shiite
Iran
,
together
with
Sunni
Arab
countries
'
dominance
of
their
Shia
minorities
,
mostly
kept
this
rivalry
in
the
background
.
43 15
These
tensions
further
receded
in
the
tide
of
the
``
Islamization
''
created
by
the
Iranian
revolution
,
for
in
its
wake
Arabs
'
sectarian
identity
as
Sunni
was
pushed
further
into
the
background
as
a
generalized
``
Islamic
''
assertiveness
appeared
.
30 15
That
all
changed
when
Al
Qaeda
,
a
Sunni
terrorist
force
that
draws
heavily
on
Saudi
Wahabbi
ideology
and
personnel
,
launched
its
attacks
on
America
in
September
2001
.
13 6
A
specifically
Sunni
brand
of
militant
Islam
was
now
on
the
march
.
29 11
When
the
United
States
initiated
wars
on
both
the
Sunni
Taliban
in
Afghanistan
and
the
Sunni
Iraqi
regime
,
this
new
radical
Sunni
strain
became
even
more
emboldened
.
50 13
The
region
's
newly
assertive
Sunni
Arabs
perceive
Israel
and
the
West
as
being
only
one
threat
,
the
other
comprising
the
so-called
``
Shia
crescent
''
--
the
arc
of
land
extending
from
Lebanon
to
Iran
through
Syria
and
Iraq
that
is
inhabited
by
the
allegedly
heretical
Shia
.
26 9
Saudi
Arabia
's
rulers
,
as
custodians
of
the
Muslim
faith
's
holiest
places
in
Mecca
and
Medina
,
perhaps
feel
this
threat
most
keenly
.
55 17
In
Sunni
eyes
,
the
Shia
not
only
dominate
the
oil-rich
areas
of
Iran
,
Iraq
,
and
the
eastern
region
of
Saudi
Arabia
,
but
are
--
through
the
actions
of
Hezbollah
--
attempting
to
usurp
the
role
of
``
protector
''
of
the
central
dream
of
all
Arabs
,
the
Palestinian
cause
.
33 13
It
is
because
the
Saudi
royal
family
derives
its
legitimacy
from
a
strict
form
of
Sunni
Islam
and
doubts
the
loyalty
of
its
Shia
population
that
the
Kingdom
has
turned
on
Hezbollah
.
30 17
Ironically
,
it
is
America
,
Saudi
Arabia
's
longtime
protector
,
which
made
Shia
empowerment
possible
by
overthrowing
Saddam
Hussein
and
bringing
Shiite
parties
to
power
in
Iraq
.
52 15
The
Bush
administration
seems
to
recognize
what
it
has
done
;
as
the
Shia
arc
rises
in
the
east
of
the
Arab
Muslim
world
,
the
US
is
attempting
to
strengthen
its
protection
of
the
Sunni
arc
--
Egypt
,
Jordan
,
and
Saudi
Arabia
--
in
the
region
's
west
.
21 10
Israel
,
the
once
implacable
enemy
of
the
Arab
cause
,
now
seems
to
be
slotted
into
this
defensive
structure
.
16 12
But
such
a
defensive
posture
is
bound
to
be
unstable
,
due
to
pan-Arab
feelings
.
25 10
Today
,
ordinary
Saudi
citizens
are
glued
to
Al
Jazeera
and
other
Arab
satellite
TV
networks
to
follow
events
in
Gaza
and
south
Lebanon
.
17 11
They
see
Arab
-LRB-
not
Shiite
-RRB-
blood
being
shed
,
with
only
Hezbollah
fighting
back
.
13 8
In
their
eyes
,
Hezbollah
has
become
a
heroic
model
of
resistance
.
12 9
This
is
causing
the
Saudi
state
to
deepen
the
Sunni-Shia
schism
.
29 9
Following
the
Kingdom
's
official
denunciation
of
Hezbollah
,
the
Saudi
state
called
on
its
official
Wahhabi
clerics
to
issue
fatwas
condemning
Hezbollah
as
Shiite
deviants
and
heretics
.
14 8
Such
condemnations
can
only
sharpen
sectarian
divisions
within
Saudi
Arabia
and
the
region
.
24 15
As
these
antagonisms
deepen
,
will
the
Sunni
regimes
come
to
believe
that
they
need
their
own
Hezbollah
to
fight
in
their
corner
?
27 13
If
that
is
what
they
conclude
,
they
need
not
look
far
,
for
many
such
fighters
have
already
have
been
trained
--
by
Al
Qaeda
.

Georgia
on
Europe
's
Mind
The
era
in
which
Europe
could
rely
on
America
to
wage
war
,
make
peace
,
and
establish
democracy
in
its
own
backyard
is
over
.
27 7
With
European
Union
enlargement
,
and
as
the
recent
Russian
gas
crisis
demonstrated
,
that
backyard
now
includes
not
just
Ukraine
,
but
Georgia
as
well
.
21 12
Indeed
,
as
in
Ukraine
,
Georgia
is
undergoing
a
test
of
democracy
that
Europe
can
not
afford
to
ignore
.
34 10
Georgia
was
the
first
post-Soviet
country
to
stage
a
``
color
revolution
,
''
and
thus
to
demonstrate
,
with
dignity
and
maturity
,
its
people
's
choice
for
democracy
and
European
values
.
47 16
The
European
Union
flags
that
have
flown
on
all
Georgian
public
buildings
since
then
signal
a
natural
attachment
,
as
old
as
the
history
of
a
country
that
,
for
the
ancient
Greeks
,
was
an
integral
part
of
the
world
as
it
was
then
known
.
24 9
Prometheus
,
Medea
,
the
Amazons
and
,
in
neighboring
Armenia
,
Noah
's
Ark
--
the
Europe
of
our
myths
starts
here
.
37 11
With
its
history
,
culture
,
and
traditions
--
including
its
critical
,
independent
,
and
even
rebellious
spirit
within
the
former
Soviet
Union
--
Georgia
would
seem
to
be
an
ideal
candidate
for
successful
democratization
.
13 8
So
it
is
all
the
more
worrisome
that
democratization
there
is
foundering
.
8 9
Everything
seemed
to
have
started
well
enough
.
32 8
Political
reforms
,
privatization
,
anti-corruption
measures
,
a
search
for
new
leaders
untainted
by
compromise
with
the
former
regime
,
and
implementation
of
a
pro-European
foreign
policy
met
no
resistance
.
28 15
But
the
totalitarian
mindset
has
since
resurfaced
in
leaders
who
,
with
their
claim
to
represent
the
will
of
the
majority
,
appropriate
more
and
more
power
.
19 9
Like
the
ancient
Greeks
'
Hydra
,
Georgia
's
political
elite
never
ceases
to
die
and
be
reborn
.
54 17
The
same
people
and
governing
methods
that
the
``
Rose
Revolution
''
of
November
2003
sought
to
defeat
have
reemerged
at
the
center
of
power
by
using
their
personal
networks
,
which
extend
outside
Georgia
's
borders
,
as
well
as
their
tremendous
wealth
and
finely
honed
skills
at
political
scheming
and
manipulation
.
26 16
This
bears
little
in
common
with
the
essence
of
democracy
,
which
consists
not
merely
in
ballot
boxes
,
but
in
the
separation
of
powers
.
34 20
The
government
meddles
in
the
affairs
of
the
parliament
,
which
in
turn
seeks
to
micro-manage
the
government
--
including
,
in
my
case
,
the
nomination
of
ambassadors
and
their
daily
routines
!
26 10
Finally
,
and
more
seriously
,
the
judiciary
is
not
yet
independent
,
undermining
the
rule
of
law
and
thus
deterring
badly
needed
private
investment
.
37 17
Georgia
's
democracy
exists
in
its
head
,
but
not
yet
in
its
body
:
citizens
still
spurn
politics
as
a
dirty
pursuit
,
abandoning
the
ground
to
those
who
should
have
been
retired
long
ago
.
19 9
But
the
hope
of
democracy
remains
strongly
rooted
in
Georgia
's
people
,
civic
organizations
,
and
media
.
15 12
Now
is
the
time
for
Europe
to
ensure
that
this
hope
is
not
extinguished
.
19 15
The
US
has
already
done
as
much
as
it
can
to
support
political
stability
in
Georgia
since
independence
.
35 16
To
be
sure
,
stability
was
not
always
identified
with
democracy
during
the
rule
of
Eduard
Shevardnadze
,
the
former
Soviet
Union
foreign
minister
who
was
ousted
as
our
president
by
the
Rose
Revolution
.
13 8
But
Americans
invested
generously
in
the
survival
of
democratic
ideas
and
leaders
.
33 13
Although
the
foundation
backed
by
the
financier
George
Soros
did
not
fabricate
the
Rose
Revolution
,
as
Russian
nationalists
claim
,
it
certainly
nurtured
,
encouraged
,
and
supported
democracy
's
preconditions
.
25 14
But
,
to
help
consolidate
its
democracy
,
Georgia
now
requires
support
of
a
different
nature
,
which
Europe
is
better
equipped
to
offer
.
38 18
The
models
for
the
balance
of
powers
,
the
functioning
of
the
judiciary
,
and
local
democracy
must
be
inspired
by
European
forms
,
which
are
closer
to
Georgian
reality
than
Anglo-Saxon
models
of
the
American
type
.
54 17
Europe
's
rejection
of
this
challenge
would
betray
its
fundamental
duties
in
a
place
--
small
,
Mediterranean
,
flexible
,
with
old
historical
traditions
--
where
democracy
stands
a
much
greater
chance
of
success
than
in
Ukraine
,
which
is
both
huge
and
still
very
Soviet-minded
,
not
to
mention
Central
Asia
.
25 9
Indeed
,
refusal
to
support
Georgia
's
struggling
democracy
would
most
likely
postpone
democratic
progress
in
Ukraine
,
Belarus
,
even
in
Russia
itself
.
6 5
This
clearly
raises
the
stakes
.
30 12
Russia
,
while
never
renouncing
its
imperial
dreams
and
instruments
of
domination
,
was
nonetheless
coming
to
terms
with
the
inevitability
of
democracy
,
at
least
on
its
margins
.
47 20
But
this
hesitant
acceptance
of
a
certain
normality
in
its
relations
with
its
neighbors
has
always
been
vulnerable
to
a
sudden
eruption
of
Russia
's
famously
irrational
``
derzhava
''
--
an
aggressive
ethos
that
glorifies
the
state
and
asserts
its
strength
by
pouncing
on
weakness
.
12 9
This
is
the
key
to
understanding
the
recent
Russian
gas
crisis
.
25 11
Just
as
surely
,
any
sign
of
a
retreat
from
democracy
in
Georgia
and
other
post-Soviet
states
will
merely
fuel
Russia
's
neo-imperial
ambitions
.
20 16
It
is
Europe
's
responsibility
to
convince
Russia
that
there
is
no
hope
of
a
return
to
the
past
.
37 17
Europe
must
assume
this
role
not
only
to
ensure
the
future
independence
of
its
energy
supply
,
but
also
to
demonstrate
that
European
values
of
freedom
,
democracy
,
and
justice
between
peoples
have
real
force
.
57 18
To
succeed
,
Europe
must
equip
itself
with
the
necessary
instruments
:
a
large
semi-public
foundation
to
promote
Europe
and
support
political
reform
,
a
university
to
train
future
executives
of
nascent
democracies
,
a
police
force
,
and
an
army
of
judges
and
magistrates
to
breathe
life
into
the
models
that
we
want
to
emulate
.
7 5
Above
all
,
Europe
needs
conviction
.
26 14
If
Europe
today
can
not
convince
itself
that
it
has
a
vital
interest
in
its
neighbors
'
future
,
who
will
believe
in
Europe
tomorrow
?
