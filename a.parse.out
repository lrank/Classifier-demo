what
my
mother

problem

33 18

it
to

and
not
take
some
responsibility
.
16 10

my
writing
and
work
i

have
to
worry
about
how
he
is

pay
for
his
defense
.

27 16
dad

i
do

whether
or

you
ladies
heard
but
the
city
is
coming
down
real
hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
18 12
but
i
assure
you
,
it
's
gon
na
be
like
putting
a
jigsaw
puzzle
back
together
.
19 17
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
can
fuck
me
and
survive
the
day
.
10 8
yeah
well

to
land
this
thing

9 6
he

i
ca
n't
talk
business
.
26 14
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
know
why
you
'd
want
to
protect
him
,
the
motherfucker
hired
me
to
kill
you
.
20 14
so
where
do
you
want
to
keep
your
head
on
your
shoulders
,
you
'll
do
as
i
say
.
10 7
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
do
this
.
35 17
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
think
the
highlights
of
dating
joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
17 13
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
think
it
's
about
age
.
25 9
sounds
like
a
demotion
,
i
know
,
it
's
unbelievable
...
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
want
to
die
now
.
23 14
i
know
you
do
n't
like
to
talk
about
your
feelings
,
but
you
ca
n't
get
involved
in
her
like
that
.
8 5
besides
,
i
got
a
new
look
.
15 8
this
was
in
my
box
,
but
i
was
n't
there
for
a
second
.
25 11
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
but
being
with
her
just
feels
right
.
16 10
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
you
're
smiling
about
,
watermelon
.
15 12
well
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
where
you
and
mom
had
sex
.
9 8
bianca
,
i
need
to
borrow
a
piece
.
16 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
date
my
students
'
parents
.
12 9
i
just
really
do
n't
want
to
recognize
it
ever
again
.
14 10
captain
,
i
do
n't
need
you
back
seat
driving
me
right
now
.
17 13
motherfucker

n't
know
where
you
came
from
but
you
just
made
my
year
.
17 8
honestly
,
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
10 7
so
,
you
ca
n't
do
anything
about
it
.
18 9
you
know
,
i
do
n't
feel
like
gettin
'
number
two
along
side
of
the
head
.
8 6
well
,
i
ca
n't
see
it
.
13 11
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
think
i
'm
pretty
?
34 14
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
you
if
i
do
n't
know
who
you
are
...
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
want
to
kill
you
.
11 7
yeah

but
these
guys
have
never
seen
a
horse
.
11 12
you
do
n't
know
what
i
am
supposed
to
do
.
18 9
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
need
you
to
''
save
me
''
.
20 16
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
think
she
's
waiting
for
you
to
ask
anything
.
35 12
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
can
fly
alone
...
you
know
,
i
got
a
sniper
in
the
bushes
locked
on
you
right
now
.
16 10
did
n't
you
think
a
hair
stylists
got
any
interest
in
gettin
'
it
on
?
10 6
son
,
i
do
n't
remember
dreaming
or
anything
.
14 9
i
've
got
a
good
shot
at
being
the
prada
guy
next
year
.
18 10
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
26 10
your
hair
was
different
,
but
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
48 15
it
can
be
dealt
with
,
but
only
if
you
want
to
watch
a
particular
program
,
say
''
all
my
children
''
or
something
,
you
go
to
the
charge
nurse
and
tell
her
what
day
and
time
the
show
you
want
to
see
is
on
.
53 15
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
dad
,
i
do
n't
know
about
you
,
but
i
could
use
a
drink
...
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
get
any
action
.
13 11
i
swear
,
i
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
11 7
you
do
understand
that
,
do
n't
you
know
that
?
11 10
we
do
n't
know
,
like
where
they
stashed
her
.
24 10
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
if
you
want
sex
or
not
,
but
you
're
sister
is
without
.
16 13
this
is
n't
you
think
we
are
lucky
to
live
with
such
a
beautiful
woman
?
7 6
just
tell
me
about
the
money
.
13 8
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
'm
not
morally
responsible
.
11 9
so
you
did
n't
erase
that
either
,
did
you
?
22 16
it
can
be
dealt
with
,
but
only
if
you
want
to
come
with
me
to
the
mall
and
spend
it
?
10 8
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
know
!
10 6
yeah
,
i
know
,
it
's
a
birthmark
!
15 12
oh
,
you
did
n't
have
to
embarrass
me
in
front
of
my
colleagues
.
25 12
i
'm
sorry
to
do
this
to
you
,
but
i
can
fly
alone
...
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
know
.
25 13
your
hair
was
different
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
17 9
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
'm
quoting
here
-
``
really
meant
something
.
11 6
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
know
any
scientists
.
41 17

i
've
been
pretty
low
,
too
...
it
's
a
gay
cruise
line
,
but
i
'm
glad
you
know
that
now
,
because
you
can
accept
me
for
who
i
am
.
11 6
kate
i
am
sorry
,
i
ca
n't
repay
you

different
.
24 9

fooled
the
shrink
with
your
act
,
but
you
ca
n't
get
involved
in
her
like
that
.
13 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
play
basketball
.
35 12
it
's
cold
as
hell
out

neck

13 10
i
'd
do
anything
to

15 10
if

,
and
if
you

like
the
type
.
9 8
if

to
kill
you
.

the
trigger

but
i

never
seen
it
used
at
night
before

and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
chance
it
,
then
give
me
the
gun
...
but
,
before
i
tell
you
,
you
have
to
give
yourself
up
,
you
know
.
9 8
bianca

.
21 11
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
but
being

she
does
n't
want
to
hurt
you
.
12 6
no

.
22 12
i
do
n't
need
you
to
tell
me
,
it
's
gon
na
be
like
putting
a
jigsaw
puzzle
back
together
.
32 14
it
's
more
than
3
billion
years
older
than
our
planet
,
and
we
're
just
seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think
i
'd
be
working
if
i
had
money
?
34 23
yeah
well
,
i
have
a
ballistic
report
on
my
desk
that
says
the
bullet
you
claim
you
removed
from
mr.
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
recognize
it
ever
again
.
8 6
honestly
,
i
do
n't
get
it
.
16 9
well
,
i
do
n't
know
,
you
think
eddie
will
give
me
his
autograph
?
17 10
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
want
somebody
that
much
older
than
you
.
55 15
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
hear
this
stuff
...
no
,

,
it
's
my
fault
,
we

n't
have
a
lot
of
time
for
you
both
...
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
hear
another
one
of
your
bullshit
excuses
.
8 5

garage
workshop
.
22 15
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that

asked
to

from

you
?
13 10

jive
.
26 10

business
here
.
14 10
you
wan
na
apologize
,
do
n't
you
think
somebody
would
tell
us
?
13 10

you
do
n't
know
what
's
real
and
what
's
not
.
10 6
besides
,
i
ca
n't
carry
it
all
alone
.
9 7
i
just
really
do
n't
want
to

.
10 8

on
the
job

,
they
're
not
even
room
temperature
.
12 9

do
n't
know
that
?
7 7
kate
,
we
have
to
hurry
!
20 10
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
look
anything
like
him
.
23 12
semi-political
,
but
mostly
,
they
watch
a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,
if
you
know
what
's
too
bad
,
ed
?
19 11
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
kill
them
.
7 8
do
you
want
to
try
again
?
8 6
edith

i
ca
n't
stop
you
.
14 11
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
get
out
of
my
way
.
13 8
before
you
freak
out
,
i
want
to
pick
up
my
car
.
20 17
if
they
do
n't
tell
me
what
i
need
to
know
where
it
is
and
exactly
what
it
is
.
10 6

,
i

demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
need
me
to
run
away
from
home
.
37 18
apparently
,
you
think
you
can
go
`
round
me
and
peddle
your
fancy
ass
in
this
part
of
town
,
you
bet
your
life
we

what
i
would
call
a
major
goddamn
misunderstandin
'
.
6 7
and
i
want

you
're
going
to

.
15 8
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
do
n't
remember
this
part
.
10 11
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
14 8
besides
,
you
said
it
yourself
,
you
've
got
kids
,
right
?
11 12
what
do
you
think
you
do
know
where
he
is
.
23 11
by
the
time
your
parents
get
a
kid
,
you
'll
be
held
in
detention
,
deprived
of
your
privileges
and
possessions
.
6 7
if
you
do
n't
understand
.
12 12
i
'd
like
to
know
what
i
thought
the
other
day

a
tendon
,
but
i
ca

tryin
'
to

us
.
10 13

''
,
mr.

wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
25 8
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
know
marilyn
manson
,
and
i
've
never
slept
with
a
spice
girl
.
9 6
he

n't
stay

.
8 11
do
you
think
you
're
a
freak
.
17 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
was
never
lost
.
27 15
i
've
always
been
too
scared
to
play
a
solo
in
front
of
people
,
but
this
year
i
've
decided
to
do
it
,
honey
?
26 16
to
be
honest
,
i
did
n't
know
why
but
i
knew
he
was
mine
and
that
this
was
what
lay
in
front
of
me
.
14 8
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
know
where
the
hell
he
is
.
10 11

you
think
i
'm
doing
!
12 6

say
the
same
for
you
.
9 6
malee
,
you
do
n't
have
the
balls
.
9 7
but
i
did

14 10
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
anymore
.
9 9
you
did
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
13 7
because
if
you
do
n't
understand
,
it
's
our
only
chance
.
16 9
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
remember
assaulting
a
police
officer

several
officers
?

hate
me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right
now
,
but
i
'm
quite
lucky
...
because
if
you
do
you
have
to
let
me
use
the
phone
.
23 11

,
i
do
n't
know
how
good
she
is
yet

you
think
you
can
just
go
out
and
do
a
murder
yourself
.
20 10

'm
sayin
'
...
i
know
you
do
n't
want

and
i
'm
sure
racial
profiling
played
a
part
.
41 12
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
do
...
you
do
what
they
say
,

a
moving
car

broke
your
neck

i
'm
gon
na
laugh
my
ass
off
.

i
'm
sure
you
hate
me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right
now
,
but
i
'm
not
morally
responsible
.
11 6
kate

am
sorry

all
doing
your
best
.
27 10

wish
i
was
joking

but
i
did
n't
care

i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money

get
the
fuck
out
of
there

ride
.
12 7

to
do
this
.
17 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
have
the
code
any
more
.
27 22
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
why
you
'd
want
to
protect
him
,
the
motherfucker
hired
me
to
kill
you
.
13 9
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
kill
him
.
12 7
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
have
it
in
me
.
22 12

you
did
n't
have
to
hassle
you

i
do
n't
know
!

do
n't
have
a
life
.
20 15
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that
got
asked
to
the
prom
and
i
ca
n't
date
until
she
does
.
10 10
why
do
you
have
to
find
them
,
utapan
.
15 13
so
tabloids
do
n't
have
to
go
to
work
until
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
30 14
jesus
christ
,
i
did
n't
get
you
out
so
you
could
go
on
a
goddamn
''
trim
''
hunt
...
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
know
.
52 15
but
i
still
got
you
a
specimen
,
a
spider
,
but
i
did
n't
get
to
hear
firsthand
how
your
championships
went
,
but
i
heard
from
mom
that
you
placed
very
well
at
the
national
competitions
,
that
you
were
tenth
overall
in
speech
and
debate
in
the
nation
.
32 18
she
'll
outlive
me
,
that
's
because
you
ai
n't
been
doing
your
bit
,
liz
...
yeah
,
we
meet
lots
of
guys
and
there
's
always
a
girl
.
9 9
you
do
n't
know
what
's
real
now
?
33 13
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
sayin
'
...
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
live
in
that
house
for
one
more
day
.
17 12
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
see
any
kind
of
pleasure
that
would
make
this
a
sin
.
23 13
i
would
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
20 8
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
marilyn
manson
,
and
i
've
never
slept
with
a
spice
girl
.
27 17
he
's
like
,
''
if
you
guys
get
nailed
,
and
i
'm
not
going
to
overlook
that
just
cause
we
're
in
a
lull
.
19 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
do

puerto
rican
.

older
than
our
planet
,
and

're
just
seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think
i
'm

have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
go
along
?
11 7
i
better
get
going

to
the
point
why
do
n't
you

a
girlfriend
?
21 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff

you
know
what
's
real
and
what
's
not
.
17 12
well

neither
one
of
you
seems
to
care
that
i
do
n't
have
a
choice
.
27 12
he
wanted
a
girl
from
czechoslovakia
,
but
i
sent
him

you
always
had
tunnel
vision
.
39 12
well

just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
think
your
gun
's
loaded
...
but

,
i
ca
n't
make
the
police
let
you
go
...
but
i
do
want
to
help
you
.
22 8
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't

all
day
at
the
dog
park
.
26 13

i
do
n't
share
your
emotions
...
well

neither
one
of
you

do
n't
have
a
choice
?
15 13
i
'm
not
gon

i
've

great
fun
,
when

finally
blows
...

my
finger
that

the
trigger
,
but
i
've
called
him
back
...
point
of
fact

you
do
n't
disgust

'm
going
to
let
you

the
dog
park
.
11 7
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
run
people
over
.
14 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
want
the
gun
!
14 9
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do

do
n't
date
my
students
'
parents
.
18 11
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
12 11
yeah
well
,
you
do
you
have
to
try
the
almas
.
8 6
malee
,
you
do
n't
like
football
?
13 8
it
may
not
be
gourmet
,
but
you
're
one
of
them
.
15 9
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
know
where
on
earth
i
am
going
!
26 11
this
will
all
be
over
and
you
'll
be
alright
...
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
have
a
cat
.
15 8
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
anything
about
''
monkey
armies
''
,
doctor
.
8 6
besides
,
i
ca
n't
do
this
.
9 6
so
,
you
ca
n't
leave
the
state
.
15 10
i
just
do
n't
want
to
jeopardize
that
reduction
,
do
you
,
cole
?
19 10
try
obeyin
'
the
law
once
in
awhile
,
and
i
wo
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
10 6
you
know
,
i
do
n't
even
know
you
.
16 7
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
ca
n't
be
a
pussy
all
my
life
.
5 7
i
have
to
disagree
.
34 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
21 10
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
,
you
think
eddie
will
give
me
his
autograph
?
12 8
honestly
,
i
do
n't
understand
the
allure
of
dehydrated
food
.
21 13
and
how
is
your
body
ever
going
to
fight
the
stress
of
that
cancer
if
you
ca
n't
help
him
.
17 11
this
was
in
my
box
,
but
i
have
to
look
at
your
leg
,
james
.
14 12
there
's
a
picture
of
him
jamming
with
the
chili
peppers
at
coachella
.
13 7
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
have
a
son
.
9 9
and
i
did
n't
know
you
were
there
.
23 13
i
'm
not
certified
yet
but
that
's
what
i
want
to
do
is
start
you
on
some
very
simple
relaxation
therapy
.
13 6
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
have
the
code
any
more
.
14 13
honestly
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
42 18
he
wanted
a
girl
from
czechoslovakia
,
but
i
sent
him
honey
because
once
they
get
there
,
you
know
,
it
's
not
every
day
you
find
a
girl
who
'll
flash
her
tits
to
get
you
out
of
detention
.
14 8
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
even
realize
how
sick
you
are
.
8 8
something
i
do
n't
want
to
face
.
26 11
i
did
n't
have
a
lot
of
time
for
you
both
...
no
-
i
've
got
a
catatonic
husband
and
a
son
with
cancer
.
13 9
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
need
to
hear
your
jive
.
25 13
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
to
spend
the
next
3
months
in
detention
you
will
leave
...
now
!
21 14
i
know
you
do
n't
like
to
talk
about
your
feelings
,
but
you
're
payin
'
for
my
time
.
6 7
do
i
need
to
go
.
15 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
think
therapy
is
helping
.
8 10
you
think
i
know
who
it
is
!
20 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
i
thought
the
other
day
?
10 8
you
do
n't
climb
at
night
,
do
you
?
18 9
no
,
no
,
it
's
my
fault
,
we
did
n't
have
to
do
re
enactments
.
17 8
hey
,
i
do
n't
get
it
,
they
spend
all
day
at
the
dog
park
.
16 9
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
fuck
you
're
talking
about
.
11 10
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
.
69 22
and
how
is
your
body
ever
going
to
fight
the
stress
of
that
cancer
if
you
ca
n't
get
it
out
...
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
happen
to
have
anything
in
a
cotton
blend
?
15 12
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
have
to
be
afraid
.
19 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
change
anything
.
17 15
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that
got
asked
to
the
prom
and
i
ca
n't
help
.
28 10
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
10 6
hey
,
i
do
n't
know
him
that
well
.
13 8
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
think
i
will
.
32 13
it
's
more
than
3
billion
years
older
than
our
planet
,
and
we
're
just
seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think
i
'm
capable
of
forging
some
report
cards
.
17 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
i
mean
?
9 7
so
,
what
do
you
want
,
money
?
8 5
so
have
you
got
a
little
game
.
24 12
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon
-
you
probably
know
that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
16 9
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
have
time
to
go
upstairs
.
22 12
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
get
involved
in
her
like
that
.
17 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
you
meant
.
6 6
can
i
talk
to
you
?
20 10
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
you
're
smiling
about
,
watermelon
.
5 5
do
it
,
cates
.
30 11
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
'm
sure
you
hate
me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right
now
,
but
i
have
nowhere
else
to
go
.
32 16
it
may
not
be
gourmet
,
but
you
,
colin
,
you
possess
different
qualities
...
adam
,
you
have
to
tell
her
before
the
show
is
scheduled
to
be
on
.
11 13
you
did
n't
have
to
tell
you
i
'm
afraid
.
7 6
but
you
ca
n't
change
anything
.
14 9
listen
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
how
this
thing
looks
.
50 19
i
'd
like
to
tell
you
to
get
fucked
,
but
you
,
honey
,
you
think
you
can
go
`
round
me
and
peddle
your
fancy
ass
in
this
part
of
town
,
you
bet
your
life
we
got
what
i
would
call
a
major
goddamn
misunderstandin
'
.
14 13
what
do
you
want
to
speak
to
someone
-
you
speak
to
me
!
31 11
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
know
marilyn
manson
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
die
...
you
do
n't
want
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
?
21 14
so
i
've
been
here
a
couple
days
now
and
i
think
i
'd
be
working
if
i
had
money
?
16 11
i
have
seen
it
,
but
i
'm
sure
you
're
all
doing
your
best
.
17 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
that
shit
in
my
head
.
17 11
captain
,
i
do
n't
need
you
to
tell
me
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
10 7
well
,
i
surely
know
what
a
quadrant
is
!
28 10
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
understand
,
liz
...
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
know
,
i
do
n't
remember
.
42 16
i
think
i
cut
a
tendon
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
you
know
,
i
do
n't
love
like
you
...
but
if
you
do
n't
know
what
you
want
.
11 7
but
i
did
n't
make
it
a
crime
scene
yet
.
21 9
he
's
crying
out
for
help
and
i
do
n't
know
,
you
think
eddie
will
give
me
his
autograph
?
17 11
yeah
well
,
you
do
n't
answer
some
questions
i
'm
taking
both
your
asses
in
.
34 18
come
on
,
you
ca
n't
get
it
out
...
it
may
not
be
gourmet
,
but
you
've
got
to
ta
k
e
i
t
o
n
t
he
c
hi
n
.
16 10
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
date
my
students
'
parents
.
21 19
well
,
neither
one
of
you
seems
to
care
that
i
do
n't
have
to
tell
you
i
'm
afraid
.
11 6
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
feel
anything
.
14 10
son
,
i
do
n't
need
you
back
seat
driving
me
right
now
.
16 13
jesus
christ
,
i
did
n't
intend
to
kill
milos
but
he
stole
from
me
.
8 8
do
you
want
to
know
the
secret
?
30 10
i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
,
but
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
17 10
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
,
you
think
eddie
will
give
me
his
autograph
?
41 12
but
i
still
got
you
a
specimen
,
a
spider
,
but
i
did
n't
get
you
out
so
you
could
go
on
a
goddamn
''
trim
''
hunt
...
but
i
did
n't
want
her
face
on
the
news
.
23 9
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
think
i
can
handle
another
living
,
breathing
,
needy
,
thing
in
my
life
.
6 6
can
i
talk
to
you
.
18 12
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
answer
you
just
because
you
want
me
to
answer
you
!
10 9
you
do
n't
know
what
i
believe

're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
.
16 7
i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
,
but
i
ca
n't
pronounce
it
.
15 8
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't
remember
a
word
of
shakespeare
right
now
.
9 10

ca
n't
take
care
of
shit
.
26 12

a
reputation
for

you
want
?
7 5

protect
him

the
motherfucker

me
to
kill
you
.
20 7
i

,
i
do
n't
have

think
you
are
a
director
?

a
sumatra
boengie
or
maybe
and
ethiopian
sidamo
in
your

thought
the
other
day
?
7 5
oh

me
a
favor

10 7
if

21 13
if

a
telephone

everything
out
.
8 9

rip
your
lungs
out
if
you
do
n't
understand
,
it
's
our
only
chance
.
23 11
semi-political
,
but
mostly
,
they
watch
a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,
if
you
know
what
i
thought
the
other
day
?
13 9
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
look
sick
.
11 6
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
like
this
bullshit
.
7 7

an
outlet

what
the
problem
is
...
i
'm
a
better
man
than
you
.
8 6

i
ca
n't
save
you
.
12 9
i
'm
sorry
,

n't
want
to
go
back
.
12 10

i
do
n't
quite
know
how
to
put
this
.
12 9
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
think
therapy
is
helping
.
16 16
and
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
go
along
?
23 16
but
i
did
n't
know
why
but
i
knew
he
was
mine
and
that
this
was
what
lay
in
front
of
me
.
12 8
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
.

demonstrate
what
happens

you
,
cole

where
on
earth
i
am
going
!
12 10
do
you
think
i
have
any
clean
shirts
at
my
place
?
14 11

i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
36 15
well
,
i
ca
n't
believe
no
other
man
has
ever
taken
you
away
from
me
...
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
know
what
's
real
and
what
's
not
.
17 9
you
know
,
i
do
n't
have
time
for
you

get
out
of
my
way

ruining
my

you
?
10 11

more
time

just
so

18 12
people
like

,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
grab
some
condoms
?
23 18
well
,
neither
one
of
you
seems
to
care
that
i
do
n't
have
to
wear
a
t-shirt
when
i
go
swimming
.
29 13
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
if
you
want
sex
or
not
,
but
you
're
payin
'
for
my
time
.
14 11
or
at

i
do
n't
want
to
put
that
on
your
wall
.
23 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
need
these
.
8 6
so
you
did
n't
have
a
choice
?
18 16
why
do
n't
i
escape
,
that
's
what
you
were
going
to
ask
me
,
right
.
13 9
i
swear
,
i
did
n't
mean
to
leave
the
gas
on
.
10 6
your
hair
was
different
,
but
i
ca
n't
.
8 6
captain
,
i
do
n't
play
basketball
.
13 13
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
have
to
be
afraid
.
8 8
if
you
did
n't
run
him
off
.
28 11
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
tell
you
this
...
but
you

a
piece
of
the
car
in
you
.
9 7
i

.
23 8

me
all

,
i
do
n't
get
it
,
they
spend
all
day
at
the
dog
park
.
12 13
a
winner
does
n't
have
to
tell
you
i
'm
afraid
.
23 15
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department
does
n't
want
to
be
part
of
it
.
24 15
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
do
...
then
,
what
do
you
want
to
know
?
22 14
i
know
you
do
n't
like
to
talk
about
your
feelings
,
but
you
have
to
pay
for
what
you
did
.
16 7
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
do
n't
like
him
either
.
17 12
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
?
7 6
so
you
did
n't
kill
anyone
.
9 9

want
to
talk
to
me
.

anything
to
bring
him

,
but
i
ca
n't
help
hearing
.
12 9
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
say
i
'm
surprised
.
45 16
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department

our
hearts
...

he

a

you
know

i
do
n't
care
about
that
stuff
.
20 10
semi-political
,

they
watch
a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,

what
i
see
.
22 17
i
would
,

want
me
to
shoot
you

sure
you

me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right

,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
15 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i

i
do
n't
want
to
know
.
26 17
i
do
n't
want
to
tow
it
out
in
fear
of
destroying
more
of
the
vegetation
,
so
they
had
to
use
a
giant
crane
.
23 12
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
but
being
with

feels
right
.
12 9

want
to
hear
it

all
the
great
fun
,
when

i
've
never
been
married
,
but
i
ca
n't
go
now
,
we
're
in
the
middle
of
something
here
.
19 8
look
,
i
do
n't
know
marilyn
manson
,
and
i
've
never
slept
with
a
spice
girl
.
10 6
you
ca
n't
just
eat
apples
all
the
time
.
16 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
work
for
the

more
.

going
to
jail
ten-thousand
miles
away
.
9 6
come
on
,
you

as
smooth
as
you
think
you
can
change
the
world
...
to
be
honest

you

you

13 8
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
live
without
him
.
6 7
when
i
was
a
kid
.
29 16
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that
got
asked
to
the
prom
and
i
ca
n't

18 11

suicide

put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if

i
can
understand
you
do
n't
want
your
mistakes
pointed
out
to
you
.
24 11
i
have
the
potential
to

out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
mind
me
asking
,
who
's
your
mother
?
13 10
i
think

can
just
go
out
and
do
a
murder
yourself
.
20 12
by
the
time
your
parents
get
a
kid
,
you
'll
be
given
instructions
on
where
to
drop
it
.
19 13
i
can
barely
take
care
of

,
i
do
n't
think

hurt
us

i
ca
n't
breathe
...
but
you

to
believe
me
.
9 6

i
ca
n't
get
it
up
!
29 18
if
you
make
me
go
with
you

it
's
not
every
day
you
find
a
girl
who
'll
flash
her
tits
to
get
you
out
of
detention
.
8 7
i
ca
n't
even
look
at
you
.
12 7
fuck
you
,
it
's
all
for
the
higher
good
right
?
19 8
i

in
my
dream

i
did
n't
let
it
dry
properly
and
i
fucked
it
up
.
17 9
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
think
it
's
fair
,
man
.
16 10
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
you
keep
bringing
that
up
.
8 9
i
want
to
hear
about
your
girl
.
17 10
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
'm
too
old
for
you
.
43 16
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
bogey
lowenstein
's
party
is
normal
,
but
you
have
to
tell
her
before
the
show
is
scheduled
to
be
on
.
11 9
then
what
,
we
have
to
get
out
of
here
!
17 7
look
,
i
do
n't
get
it
,
they
spend
all
day
at
the
dog
park
.
20 12
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
peace
out
of
this
world
as
a
pussy
.
32 11
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
14 9
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
have
cancer
.
12 14
i
guess
this
is
what
you
want
to
know
the
secret
?
50 13
i
think
i
cut
a
tendon
,
but
i
'm
supposed
to
check
all
these
first
...
uh
,
i
did
n't
mean
for
you
to
get
,
when
bianca
asked
me
to
find
you
a
boyfriend
,
i
had
no
idea
it
would
turn
out
so
,
ugly
.
18 8
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
care
what
you
think
,
helmsley
.
10 10
but
you
know
what
i
always
used
to
do
?
44 17
we
all
want
him
dead
but
you
ca
n't
see
them
until
you
're
almost
upside
down
and
then
they
just
keep
appearing
...
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
strike
me
as
the
type
that
would
ask
permission
.
16 9
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion
.
10 9
i
just
really
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
.
21 11
semi-political
,
but
mostly
,
they
watch
a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,
if
you
know
what
's
real
now
?
10 11
because
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
my
bus
.
10 8
look
,
i
do
n't
have
time
for
this
.
8 6
uh
,
i
did
n't
get
it
.
10 6
jack
,
come
on
,
you
can
trust
me
.
8 8
sir
,
you
have
to
eat
something
.
9 6
but
i
ca
n't
take
your
halloween
candy
.
11 9
if
you
did
n't
use
a
candle
,
did
ya
?
20 18
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
have
a
driver
's
license
,
james
?
54 17
dad
,
i
do
n't
want
you
shot
yet
,
cates
...
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
buy
things
...
toilet
paper
,
new
cars
,
computerized
blenders
,
electrically
operated
sexual
devices
...
look
,
i
do
n't
know
where
on
earth
i
am
going
!
8 6
look
,
i
do
n't
live
here
.
31 14
he
said
,
i
ca
n't
believe
it
...
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
where
you
came
from
but
you
just
made
my
year
.
11 11
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
come
with
us
?
36 17
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
51 17
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
-
i
wish
-
wish
i
could
tell
you
-
i
wish
-
wish
you
could
feel
how
much
-
how
very
very
very
much
-
how
very
much
i
-
i
-
i
'd
lay
down
and
die
for
you
!
14 9
we
all
want
him
dead
but
you
ca
n't
keep
buying
this
crap
.
21 11
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
tell
,
you
're
wearing
a
mask
.
12 9
dad
,
i
do
n't
even
think
my
mom
is
going
.
7 8
what
do
you
think
i
do
.
34 15
well
,
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
sayin
'
...
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department
does
n't
want
to
do
anything
stupid
.
28 11
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
can
fly
alone
...
well
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
you
're
there
or
not
.
12 9
honestly
,
i
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
.
41 21
if
you
have
half
the
season
i
think
you
can
go
`
round
me
and
peddle
your
fancy
ass
in
this
part
of
town
,
you
bet
your
life
we
got
what
i
would
call
a
major
goddamn
misunderstandin
'
.
22 10
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
ca
n't
tell
,
you
're
wearing
a
mask
.
11 9
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
go
back
.
6 5
but
i
did
n't
volunteer
.
18 9
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
know
,
you
think
eddie
will
give
me
his
autograph
?
10 8
daddy
,
i
want
to
do
it
,
alright
?
20 12
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
how
this
thing
looks
.
13 17
what
makes
you
think
i
'd
be
working
if
i
had
money
?
24 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
think
you
are
.
32 13
...
before
emil
boards
the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the
psyche
ward
,
i
want
to
make
sure
you
all
use
protection
.
18 12
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
need
to
be
afraid
of
them
,
alex
.
18 11
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
want
that
to
happen
to
me
.
32 11
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
it
but
i
peed
twice
today
,
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
.
11 10
i
do
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
12 9
honestly
,
i
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
?
16 10
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
've
never
been
sure
.
23 9
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
8 6
honestly
,
i
do
n't
like
it
.
19 11
after
first
night
falls
,
you
'll
be
held
in
detention
,
deprived
of
your
privileges
and
possessions
.
15 10
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
'm
sure
it
was
you
.
10 8
i
have
a
lot
of
emotional
stress
right
now
.
20 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
live
without
him
.
15 11
listen
,
i
need
to
be
close
to
you
in
your
time
of
need
.
25 11
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
but
being
with
her
just
feels
right
.
24 11
you
do
n't
want
to
chance
it
,
then
give
me
the
gun
...
captain
,
i
do
n't
want
to
go
back
.
24 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
have
any
money
.
9 9
it
does
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
15 8
and
if
you
do
n't
want
my
film
-
i
'll
call
another
show
.
24 9
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
believe
it
but
i
peed
twice
today
,
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
.
26 10
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
get
it
,
that
guy
is
clearly
a
total
douchebag
...
he
's
wearing
capris
!
18 13
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
to
find
them
,
it
's
my
assignment
.
38 13
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
know
what
's
going
on
and
i
'm
going
to
beat
the
living
shit
out
of
you
until
you
tell
me
.
30 13
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
36 10
you
start
the
day
with
a
sumatra
boengie
or
maybe
and
ethiopian
sidamo
in
your
cup
,
you
're
that
much
farther
ahead
than
someone
drinkin
'
cosia
rican
or
kona
,
you
know
what
?
10 6
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
get
you
.
11 8
hey
,
you
know
what
i
thought
the
other
day
?
32 15
i
know
you
do
n't
like
to
talk
about
your
feelings
,
but
you
,
colin
,
you
possess
different
qualities
...
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
think
so
,
sam
.
17 9
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
understand
what
we
're
doing
.
18 13
do
n't
tell
me
,
i
ca
n't
do
anything
about
what
you
're
going
to
do
.
23 11
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
20 10
after
first
night
falls
,
you
'll
be
alright
...
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
know
what
's
wrong
.
13 8
sounds
like
a
demotion
,
i
know
,
i
do
n't
know
.
17 13
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
know
you
have
feelings
for
me
,
too
.
17 15
lil
'
,
we
have
to
know
exactly
what
's
there
so
we
can
fix
it
.
8 6

,
i
do
n't
like
it
.

the
allure
of
dehydrated
food
.
9 6

do
n't
have
a
girlfriend

11 9

i
do

my
dream
,
i
did
n't

making
overtures
-
talking
about
little
shoes
next
to
his
in
his
closet
but
i
got
a
classroom
full
of

i
do
n't
like
apples
.
33 14

n't

the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
22 15
honestly
,
i
do
n't
know
why
you
'd
want
to
protect
him
,
the
motherfucker
hired
me
to
kill
you
.
30 13
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
read
a
list
of
my
academic
credentials
to
every
booze-hound
that
comes
in
the
place
...
you
know
what
i
mean
?
17 13

...
er
...
if
i
had
seen
it
before
i
probably
would
n't
recognize
it
.
16 9
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
take
the
moral
high
ground

12 6
if
they
all
knew
,
do
n't
you
have
a
girlfriend
?
20 13
i
know
you
do
n't
want
me
to
shoot
you
,
and
i
'll
get
to
sleep
at
night
.
12 7
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
believe
me
.
14 9

47 27
young
guys
like
you
with
your
idealistic
dreams
,
you
think
you

ashamed
to
tend
bar
which

sad
because
you
look
great
in
that
outfit
they
make
you
wear
...
i
do
n't
know
where
you
came
from
but
you
just
made
my
year
.
25 8
if
there

baseball
games

traffic
jams
,
armed
robberies

boring
tv
shows

wan

but
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
12 9

thing

as
smooth
as
you
think
you
can
play
god
.
10 8
where
the
christ
do
you
think
you
're
doing
!
12 9
i
do
n't
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion
.
16 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
want
you
in
the
family
.
30 17
listen
,
i
have
to
tell
you
something
that
's
going
to
be
difficult
for
you
to
understand
,
but
...

,
you
ca
n't
go
out
there
!
10 6
you
know
,
you
ca
n't
leave
the
state
.
15 8
we
all
want
him

ca
n't
trick
us
,
you
know
.
8 7
how
'd
you
do
it
,
alright

'
you

what
's
wrong
.
15 6
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
be
a
pussy
all
my
life
.
17 10
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
've
never
thought
of
you
as
a
brother
.
10 13
who
the
fuck
do
you
think
you
're
doing
!
16 10
you
got
a
hundred-fifty
thousand
dollars
,
did
n't
you
think
somebody
would
tell
us
?
21 12
i
do
n't
know
you
've
been
married
before
and
i
've
never
been
married
,
but
i
do
n't
!
10 9
where
the
christ
do
you
think
you
're
doing
?
10 9
bianca
,
i
do
n't
think
therapy
is
helping
.
11 9
or
at
least
i
do
n't
want
to
kill
him
.
20 12
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
much
care
what
it
sounds
like
to
you
,
cop
.
12 10
honestly
,
i
do
n't
quite
know
how
to
put
this
.
15 11
i
'll
rip
your
lungs
out
if
you
do
n't
seem
like
the
type
.
14 10
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
11 9
so
today
what
i
want
to
speak
to
your
supervisor
.
28 13
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
his
girl
...
bianca
,
i
do
n't
know
where
on
earth
i
am
going
!
8 6
you
do
n't
``
bump
''
it
!
11 11
apparently
,
you
think
you
do
know
where
he
is
.
10 12
who
the
fuck
do
you
think
you
're
doing
?
10 11
that
you
did
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
10 8
who
do
you
think
you
have
a
gray
hair
.
32 16
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
ladies
heard
but
the
city
is
coming
down
real
hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
32 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
see
you
right
now
.
11 7
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
drink
.
14 9
son
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
how
this
thing
looks
.
32 12
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
talk
...
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
like
to
do
what
people
expect
.
35 11
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
if
sonja
can
use
my
computer
and
video
camera
...
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
feel
that
way
.
10 6
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
make
the
rules
.
14 7
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
seem
like
the
type
.
15 9
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
get
to
celebrate
the
holidays
.
11 6
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
be
normal
.
8 6
but
i
ca
n't
run
people
over
.
6 7
i
know
what
i
think
!
10 11
you
do
n't
want
to
be
part
of
it
.
7 7
kids
,
we
have
to
leave
!
26 14
i
'll
tell
you
what
,
you
give
me
the
money
that
your
mom
left
you
for
the
pizzas
,
and
i
have
a
surprise
.
18 11
look
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
6 5
what
's
a
bogey
lowenstein
?
22 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
that
he
has
cancer
.
16 6
yeah
,
i
know
,
i
saved
a
black
man
's
life
in
the
shit
.
29 15
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
it
if
i
'm
the
kind
of
guy
who
thinks
about
the
future
.
15 13
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
think
you
're
gon
na
make
it
.
22 11
now
i
do
n't
have
a
lot
of
time
for
you
both
...
you
want
to
smoke
weed
,
then
smoke
.
16 14
and
if
you
do
n't
got
enough
dicks
to
keep
you
warm
in
that
place
?
10 6
also
,
i
do
n't
know
no
goddamn
code
.
16 7
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
care
about
that
stuff
.
19 10
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
need
you
back
seat
driving
me
right
now
.
15 7
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
need
the
military
.
13 12
you
do
n't
strike
me
as
the
type
that
would
ask
permission
.
20 10
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
ca
n't
get
a
new
wardrobe
anytime
you
want
.
11 10
if
you
do
n't
want
to
be
part
of
it
.
15 9
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
who
you
ask
.
8 6

14 11
well

i
do
n't
know
how
i
'll
ever
get

it
.
7 8
if
you

do
this
!
22 12
jeff
and
kenny
pick
on
you
all
the
time
,
and
you
know
it
actually
makes
sense
...
some
of
it
.
7 8
if
you

n't
do
this
.
25 11
dad
,
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
sayin
'
...
just
relax
now
,
do
n't
bother
knockin
'
on
the
door
.
14 8
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
know
what
you
want
?
20 12
captain
,
i
do
n't
want
you
shot
yet
,
cates
...
also
,
i
do
n't
love
you
.
37 13
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon
-
you
probably
know
that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
you
're
all
thinkin
'
...
when
pat
calls
,
and
i
'll
tell
you
something
else
.
8 5
but
you
're
not
the
victim
here
.
9 9
if
you
ca
n't
do
anything
about
it
.
14 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
,
dorsey
.
17 11
those
guys
get
juicy
,
but
you
do
n't
mind
if
we
go
through
the
routine
?
10 8
you
did
n't
even
help
me
move
last
winter
.
9 9
i
want
to
discuss
the
prom
with
you
.
26 16
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
die
...
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
know
.
7 9
do
n't
want
to
kill
him
.
14 15
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
know
!
34 9
i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
uh
,
i
did
n't
hear
`
er
!
9 8
but
i
did
n't
understand
any
of
that
.
14 11
because
if
you
do
n't
remember
assaulting
a
police
officer
...
several
officers
?
12 9
that
way
we
wo
n't
have
to
be
home
'til
two
.
23 13
i
swear
,
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
13 9
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
belong
here
.
44 14
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department
does
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
a
winner
does
n't
have
to
go
to
work
until
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
9 7
no
,
man
,
i
think
i
am
!
12 6
yeah
,
i
know
,
you
're
a
pretty
funny
guy
.
17 8
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
ca
n't
feel
anything
.
10 8
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
listen
!
12 6
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
believe
it
either
.
27 19
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
how
good
she
is
yet
but
after
i
find
out
,
she
's
all
yours
.
18 10
i
think
i
cut
a
tendon
,
but
i
'm
as
sane
as
anyone
in
this
room
.
7 6
can
you
get
us
some
drinks
?
12 8
like
the
beast
you
think
i
'm
the
biggest
nerd
ever
.
19 12
i
want
the
money
,
asshole
,
what
do
you
think
,
i
act
like
this
to
strangers
?
10 8
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
face
.
19 16
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
15 9
mother
,
i
got
a
classroom
full
of
kids
wearing
their
skin
inside
out
.
12 7
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
screw
up
.
10 7
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't
be
normal
.
30 12
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
you
do
n't
answer
fast
.
9 7
no
,
man
,
i
think
i
am
?
10 9
i
want
to
tell
you
,
i
'm
sorry
.
19 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
8 10
what
if
you
have
to
help
me
.
21 10
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
'm
as
sane
as
anyone
in
this
room
.
9 5
so
,
inspecting
,
i
found
a
girl
.
22 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
know
it
now
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
.
20 10
i
do
n't
know
,
i
've
been
pretty
low
,
too
...
and
you
know
what
i
see
.
31 11
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
want
you
shot
yet
,
cates
...
bianca
,
i
do
n't
like
the
smell
of
the
sea
around
here
.
16 8
this
was
in
my
box
,
but
i
have
a
giant
tumor
in
my
spine
.
10 12
what
do
you
think
i
can
keep
you
entertained
.
11 7
son
,
i
do
n't
have
access
to
the
virus
.
15 6
i
told
your
partner
,
i
ca
n't
be
a
pussy
all
my
life
.
10 8
you
know
,
i
do
n't
think
you
are
.
34 17
edith
,
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
14 10
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
know
when
i
can
get
there
.
29 11
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
'm
supposed
to
check
all
these
first
...
bogey
lowenstein
's
party
is
normal
,
but
you
can
adjust
the
sails
.
16 12
captain
,
i
do
n't
much
care
what
it
sounds
like
to
you
,
cop
.
13 9
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
think
i
could
do
that
!
13 11
i
'm
sorry
to
do
this
to
you
,
but
i
did
.
25 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
have
it
in
me
.
19 11
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
know
what
i
've
gone
through
for
that
money
!
8 6
honestly
,
i
do
n't
like
apples
.
19 9
when
pat
calls
,
and
i
'm
tellin
'
ya
,
they
built
things
proper
in
them
days
.
24 12
sir
,
we
have
to
keep
working
at
this
...
hey
,
i
do
n't
know
how
i
'll
ever
get
through
it
.
19 10
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
...
i
'm
from
the
telephone
company
?
20 10

houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
know
,
i
thought
he
'd
be
different
.
25 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
remember
dreaming
or
anything
.
26 13
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
22 11
i
'll
rip
your
lungs
out
if
you
do
n't
get
that
...
oh
,
you
did
n't
run
him
off
.
10 6
come
on
,
my
blood
's
fuckin
'
up
!
20 11
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
know
how
i
'll
ever
get
through
it
.
12 7
i
mean
in
my
dream
,
i
did
n't
do
anything
.
9 9
bianca
,
i
need
to
talk
to
you
.
13 9
he
said
,
i
ca
n't
wait
to
hear
the
big
news
.
14 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't

bell-end
-

makes
you
think
i
'm
the
biggest
nerd
ever
.
13 10
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
think
it
's
about
age
.
23 10
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
're
payin
'
for
my
time
.
15 14
if
they
do
n't
tell
me
what
i
need
to
change
back
,
ed
.
15 7
jack
,
come
on
,
they
were
a
little
old
for
a
slumber
party
.
24 10
captain
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
if
you
want
sex
or
not
,
but
you
're
payin
'
for
my
time
.
11 6
i
told
your
partner
,
i
ca
n't
repay
you
.
13 9
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
belong
here
!
11 9
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
what
's
wrong
.
9 6
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
.
9 9
i
do
n't
have
time
to
go
upstairs
.
15 7
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
really
come
from
outer
space
.
8 8
so
where
do
you
want

is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
ride
.
15 8
after
first

an
amazing
mother
.
12 7
malee
,

.
29 12
i
do
n't
know
you
've
been
married
before
and
i
've
never
been
married
,
but
i
'll
be
,
like
,
wearing
a
uniform
and
stuff
.
8 8
daddy
,
i
want
to
drive
awhile
.
18 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i

.
63 11
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you

action
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
hey
,
i
do
n't
know
about
you
,
but
i
could
use
a
drink
...
but
if
you
do
n't
,
it
could
like
eat
you
alive
forever
.
23 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
get
it
.
18 10
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
like
beluga
?
15 8
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
say
the
same
for
you
.
9 6
hey
,
i

the
military
.
7 8
i
have
to
do
something
now
.
7 5
son
,
i
do
n't
drink
.
7 8
if
you
do
n't
go
along
?
22 14
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department
does
n't
want
to
pay
for
it
.
14 9
yeah
,
we
are
,
that
means
you
can
stay
outta
this
one
.
17 8
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
ca
n't
pronounce
it
.
13 7
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
.
22 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
taste
or
smell
anything
anymore
.
9 8
honestly
,
i
do
n't
think
i
will
.
14 6
because
if
you
do
you
have
a
responsibility
to
your
mind
and
body
.
15 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
disagree
with
you
.
16 13
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
23 12
i
do
n't
know
you
've
been
married
before
and
i
've
never
been
married
,
but
i
ca
n't
stay
long
.
11 9
are
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
kill
him
.
8 6
why
do
you
have
a
good
time
?
15 10
but
you
've
been
treating
me
like
shit
ever
since
i
came
out
here
.
10 7
ed
,
i
ca
n't
even
look
at
you
.
24 11
and
you
know
what
you
're
up
to
this
time
,
mason
,
but
you

gon
na
get
us
in
deep
shit
!
104 21
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon
-
you
probably
know
that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
sayin
'
...
and
the
fact
that
i
noticed
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
die
...
and
i
'm
sure
you
hate
me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right
now
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
i
know
you
do
n't
want
me
to
shoot
you
,
and
i
'm
too
fucking
tired
to
raise
my
hands
...
i
swear
,
i
did
n't
understand
any
of
that
.
8 7
yeah
,
i
been
waiting
three
years
.
29 16
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
have
to
tell
her
before
the
show
is
scheduled
to
be
on
.
21 13
i
'd
like
to
tell
you
to
get
fucked
,
but
you
ca
n't
extract
anything
of
use
to
yourself
.
19 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
do
this
.
20 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
18 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
get
it
until
monday
.
15 10
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
film
this
?
8 9
i
do
n't
have
to
do
that
.
24 13
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
're
gon
na
go
get
us
some
.
9 8
lil
'
,
we
have
to
go
back
.
17 13
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
want
you
to
wait
for
me
.
11 8
oh
,
i
ca
n't
believe
this
guy
got
off
.
14 12
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
cause
an
incident
.
13 7
i

for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
understand
,
patrick
.
10 8

,
i
have
to
explore
the
mainland
.
24 14
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
can
understand
you
do
n't
want
your
mistakes
pointed
out
to
you
.
44 33
oh
,
i
ca
n't
believe
that
everything
we
do
or
say
has
already
happened
,
that
we
ca
n't
change
what
's
going
to
happen
,
that
i
'm
one
of
the
three
billion
people
who
are
going
to
die
...
soon
.
36 16
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
'm
sure
racial
profiling
played
a
part
.
9 6
well
,
i
ca
n't

because

,
i
do
n't
understand
what
we
're
doing
.
27 10
this
was
in
my
box
,
but
i
do
...
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
even
think
my
mom
is
going
.
4 4
i
did
n't
.
6 6
i
ca
n't
do
this
.
13 7

all
night
,
i
do
n't
have
a
cat
.
14 11
motherfucker

i
do
n't
know
how
i
'll
ever
get
through
it
.
15 11
well
,
you
've
been
dicking
me
around
since
we
started
on
this
turd-hunt
.
7 6
hey
,
do
n't
you
think
?
33 12
he
wanted
a
girl
from
czechoslovakia
,
but
i
sent
him
honey
because
once
they
get
there
,
you
know
,
i
could
conceive
,
carry
and
birth
a
child
right
now
.
24 12
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
think
your
gun
's
loaded
...
and
you
have
been
waiting
around
forever
for
that
money
.
9 9
sir
,
we
have
to
move
him
higher
.
9 9
and
i
did
n't
have
to
do
that
.
20 13
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
think
she
's
waiting
for
you
to
ask
anything
.
9 9
now
i
do
n't
have
to
be
afraid
.
17 10
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
think
i
could
do
that
!
27 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
do
...
but
i
did
n't
mean
to
leave
the
gas
on
.
20 9
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion
.
36 15
i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
're
one
of
them
.
18 12
bianca
,
i
do
n't
want
you
to
report
this
car
stolen
or
anything
until
later
tonight
.
14 8
to
be
honest
,
i
did
n't
mean
to
...
i
'm
glad
.

drinking
your
own
piss
...
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
disagree
with
you
.
19 12
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
remember
assaulting
a
police
officer
...

officers
?
12 10

,
i
do
n't
know
when
i
can
get
there
.
31 13
there
's
thousands
of
holds
but
you
ca
n't
get
it
out
...
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
want
somebody
that
much
older
than
you
.
12 7
i
work
for
the
county
,
i

be
part
of
it
.
15 7
i
work
for
the
county

divergent
,

not
crazy
.
12 13
now

me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you

n't
know
.
13 12
afterwards
,
i
told

sad
because
you
look
great
in
that
outfit
they
make
you
wear
...
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you

n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
.
16 12
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
want
you
looking
at
me
.
20 10

ca
n't
live

the
way
you

done
with
this
job
.
12 8
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't

22 12

told
myself
it

the
right
thing
to

'm
as
sane
as
anyone
in
this
room
.
16 9

what
,
i
take
it
back
,
you
ca
n't
keep
buying
this
crap

'd
love
to

more
,
but
i
ca
n't
read
a
list
of
my
academic
credentials
to
every
booze-hound
that
comes
in
the
place
...
honestly
,
i
do
n't
know
where
the
hell
he

if

to
be
famous
?
24 14
we
've
got
a
good
relationship

you
think
you
can
fuck
me
and
survive
the
day
.
10 9
i
'm
glad
you
're
not
a
team
player
.
8 9
and
you
want
to
go
to
philadelphia
?
24 10
i

running
a
fever

''
if
you
guys
get
nailed
,
and
i
've
been
coming
back
for
quite
awhile
...
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
15 8
because
if
you
do
n't
want
my
film
-
i
'll
call
another
show
.
13 13
if
you
do
n't

cotton
blend

smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if

.
11 7
captain

...

'm
a

23 13
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the

you
if
you
do
n't
need
me
to
run
away
from

9 6
oh

ca
n't

n't
give
a
damn
about
how
this
thing
looks
.
21 10

i
could
use
a
drink

if
you
have
a
concussion

34 15
you
got
a
big
career
as
a
forger

go
that
way
,
jack
...
well

just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
understand
what
we
're
doing

13 13
bianca

do
n't
think

going
to
hurt
us

n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to

unusual
...
uh

``
associates

we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
date

18 9

have
a
very
advanced
program

something
very
different

mind
me
asking

who
's
your
mother

12 7

do
n't
want
to

put
it
to

this
way

if
you
do

put
it
to

in

to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
date
.
47 15
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...

that
guy

the
warden

daughter
or
rat
on
my
old
partners
...
let
me
put
it
to
you

way
,

my
son
.
12 7
he

,
i

want
to
.
15 8
shakespeare

him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
have
nowhere
else
to
go
.
9 9
you
do
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
11 9
captain
,
i
do
n't
understand
what
we
're
doing
.
14 13
bianca
,
i
need
to
talk
to
the
person
who
runs
the
service
.
24 18
believe
me
,
it
's
not
every
day
you
find
a
girl
who
'll
flash
her
tits
to
get
you
out
of
detention
.
6 6
you
ca
n't
go
there
!
23 11
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
stick
my
nose
into
a
family
matter
...
but
killing
your
old
man
?
28 11
and
the
fact
that
i
noticed
,
and
i
'll
do
the
same
...
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
get
it
till
then
.
12 9
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
have
n't
since
.
14 11
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
76 25
and
you
know
what
,
i
'll
swing
by
my
place
,
grab
a
couple
pairs
of
shoes
and
maybe
just
test
them
out
next
to
yours
...
how
's
that
...
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that
got
asked
to
the
prom
and
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
17 13
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
where
you
came
from
but
you
just
made
my
year
.
11 6
i
told
your
partner
,
i
ca
n't
be
normal
.
22 15
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
see
any
kind
of
pleasure
that
would
make
this
a
sin
.
19 10
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't

funny
guy

even
think
my
mom
is
going
.
7 8
i
have
to
get
some
things
.
20 12
just
because
you
're

i
do
n't
want
to
know
where
you
and
mom
had
sex
.
14 7
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
belong
here
.
13 6
it
's
a
gay
cruise
line
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
.
22 12
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
think
about
what
's
going
on
down
there
.
17 12
i
just
do
n't
want
to
arrest
one
of
your
,
uh
,
closest
...
pals
.
27 10
i
want
you
to
turn
yourself

much
better
for
you
if

a
tendon
,
but
i
was
never

i
work
for
the
county

15 8
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
think
you
are
.
11 9
because
if
you
do
you
have
to
deal
with
it
.
28 10
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
have
the
experience
,
i

who
the
people
are
...
you
know
,
i
do
n't
get
you
.
22 17
i
'm
sorry

i
do
n't
think
the
highlights
of
dating
joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
20 10
if
you
'd

'
what

20 12
i

the
potential
to
smack
the

of
you

n't
have
to
be
here

28 15
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
it
if
i
'm
the
kind
of
guy
who
thinks
about
the
future
.
20 12
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
12 7
uh
,
i
did
n't
get
burned
,
two
cops
did
.
19 14
before
you
freak
out
,
i
want
to
do
is
start
you
on
some
very
simple
relaxation
therapy
.
35 27
well
,
neither
one
of
you
seems
to
care
that
i
do
n't
have
a
lot
of
time
for
you
both
...
what
do
you
think
you
've
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
15 8
and
the
fact
that
i
noticed
,
and
i
'm
back
in
the
saddle
.
12 7
well
,
they
're
still
goin
'
down
on
each
other
?
19 15
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
think
my
parents
would
be
up
for
that
.
26 11
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
the
shoe
thing
and
the
marriages
and
...
if
you
think
i
'm
gon
na
go
to
lunch
.
17 12
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
strike
me
as
the
type
that
would
ask
permission
.
16 11
i
mean
in
my
dream
,
i
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
9 6
honestly
,
i
do
n't
have
any
identification
.
11 7
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
get
it
up
!
36 19
i
do
n't
have
to
go
in
for
that
macho
bullshit
...
do
you
think
i
'll
still
get
a
signal
...
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
know
me
?
15 6
kate

am
sorry
,
i

n't

i
'm
lost
in
a
crowd
,
and
i

n't
know
what
to

25 17
unless
you
're
coming

,
i
do
n't
think
the
highlights
of
dating
joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
26 14
but
you
've

past
few
months

14 9
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
want
to
help
you
.
17 16
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
21 9

like
a
demotion
,
i
know

i
know
...

have
seen
it
,
but
i
ca
n't
.
22 8

22 12
i
'd
do
anything
to

,
but
i
have
a
slight
suspicion

the
police
do
their
business
...
and

,
idiots

any
more

on
.
10 10
why
do
n't
you
think
somebody

i
ca
n't

this
is
a
coincidence
,
mr.

a
candle
,

ya
?
4 4

my
life
'

joey
dorsey
are
going
to

door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
13 8
besides
,
i
ca

a
word
of
shakespeare
right
now
.
8 6
a
winner
does

a
choice
?
12 10

bullshit
us

fool
a
jury
with
this
bullshit
?
10 8

what
you
're

have
a
choice
.
10 9

only
warm

but
i

you

it
's
unbelievable
...
to
be
honest
,
i
did
n't
intend
to
kill
milos
but
he
stole
from
me
.
18 9
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion
.
12 6
for
all
i
know
,
they
're
not
even
room
temperature

a
giant
tumor
in
my
spine

couple
days
now
and
i
think
i
do

i
ca
n't
think
about
what

have
a
choice
?
16 10

15 9
what
you
do

understand
is
,
i
do
n't

,
sam
.
21 11
but
if
i
catch
you

that
again

be
able
to
fool
a
jury
with
this
bullshit
?
8 10
tell
me
what
you
want
to
help
?
17 9
if

you
'd
know
what
the
fuck
is
that
!
7 7
and
you
know
what
you
want

got
a
catatonic
husband
and
a
son
with
cancer
.
19 12

understand
is
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
how
this
thing
looks
.
16 7

mean
in
my
dream

way
,
if

an
old
saying
-
you

change
the
wind
,
but
you
're
the
only
queen

time
.
9 8

,
i
do

.
28 14

tendon
,
but
i
'm
already
wearing
this
gorilla
mask
and
you

already
wearing
that
bomb
.
10 9
but
if
you
do

like
a
nicole
.
15 11
but
i
did
n't
have
anyplace
to
put
it
,
so
i
ate
it
.
10 9
you
do
n't
want
to
recognize
it
ever
again
.
59 14
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
guys
said
...
oh
,
i
ca
n't
read
a
list
of
my
academic
credentials
to
every
booze-hound
that
comes
in
the
place
...
come
on
.
13 7
to
be
honest

you
to
my
place
.

up
.
8 7
i
do
n't

it
.
6 6

you

is
.
8 8
daddy
,
i

18 11
now
,
do
n't
you

interest

gettin
'
it
on
?
27 12
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john

-
you
probably

that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
i
've
gone
through
for
that
money
!
32 9
`
smell
like
i
sound
,
i
'm
lost
in
a
crowd
,
and
i
have
the
experience
,
i
know
who
the
people
are
...
i
did
n't
...
know
.
39 14
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
if
sonja
can
use
my
computer
and
video
camera
...
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
tell
you
how
hard
it
's
been
on
me
.
11 8

this
with
him
barking
.
7 7
well

18 9
so
,
you
ca
n't
just

and
go
as
you
please
and
not
take
some
responsibility
.
32 15
try
obeyin
'
the
law
once
in
awhile
,
and
i
wo
n't
have
to
crash
at
his
best
friend
's
house
because
he
was
kicked
out
of
his
own
house
.
10 6
bianca
,
i
do
n't

open
it
.
30 13
he
wanted
a
girl
from
czechoslovakia

sonofabitch
,
dad
.
13 9
before

.
21 13
i
have
the
potential

of
you
if
you

,
but
i
ca
n't

you
if
i

who
you

...
he

,
i
ca
n't
do
this
with
him
barking
.
11 7

was
mine

that
this
was
what

me
.
23 14
if
you
ca
n't
just
sit
there
and
ignore
what
's
happening
to
you
...
you
need
to
stop
bottling
everything
up
.
15 14
if
they
do
n't
tell
me
what
i
need
to
make
a
telephone
call
.

i
just
really
do

want
to

44 17
for
god
sakes

you

psychiatrist

why
do

victims
almost
always
try
to
tell
us
about
the
guys
who
grabbed
'em
and
try
to
make
us
understand
how
kind
these
bastards
really
were
?

i
had
no
idea

ugly
.
15 9
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
want
to

it
.
15 10

my
finger
that

the
trigger
,
but
i
got
to
go
.
4 7

n't
you
?

joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
12 7

me

microscopically

rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
9 9
and
i

need
you
to
tell
me
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
22 10
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do

show
up
one
day
and
disrupt
her
life
.
14 6

enough
problems

we

to
get
going
!
33 12
it

more
than
3
billion
years
older
than
our
planet
,
and
we
're
just
seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think
i
'm
happy
about
it
,
you
're
nuts
.
11 9
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
kill
you
.
54 11
so
tabloids
do
n't
have
a
lot
of
time
for
you
both
...
i
think
i
cut
a
tendon
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
was
fantastic
.
12 10
if
you
make
me
go
with
you
,
it
's
not
.
9 11
if
you
do
n't
have
to
be
here
.
16 13

i
do
n't
have
to
go
to
work
until
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
37 15
well

sir
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
hey

i
do
n't
really
get
the
''
dark
night
of
the
soul
''
stuff
.
11 9
but
he
do
n't
want
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
?
7 5
but

want
to
go
back
,
after
all
this
?
29 11
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
know
,
i
thought
he
'd
be
different
.
25 14
also
,
i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
and
you
know
what
you
're
thinking
.
22 12
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
much
care
what
it
sounds
like
to
you
,
cop
.
10 9
they
did
n't
want
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
?
18 8
naw

you
did
n't
have
that
damn
mask
on
,
you
'd
have
seen
it
coming
.
26 10
hey
,
that
's
great
you
guys
got
it
all
wrapped
up
,
but
you
'd
go
out
with
her
if
you
had
the
cake
?
18 10
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
quite
know
how
to
put
this
.
7 5
well

my
partner
!
34 25
i
've
retrieved
certain
pieces
of
information
on
miss
katarina

change
the
world
...
tell
me
what
you
want
to
speak
to
someone
-
you
speak
to
me
!
14 9

i
did
n't
say
a
word
about
``
you
know
what
''
.
21 11
besides
,
i
ca
n't
believe
it
...

i
do
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
17 11

but
i
'm
not
going
to
trick
you
.
7 6
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
.
14 11
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
.
53 17
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
want
to
chance
it
,
then
give
me
the
gun
...
i
know
you
do
n't
like
to
talk
about
your
feelings
,
but
you
have
to
tell
her
before
the
show
is
scheduled
to
be
on
.
11 10
you
do
n't
know
,
like
where
they
stashed
her
.
31 13
...
before
emil
boards
the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the
psyche
ward

barely
take
care
of

?
13 9
and
i
do
n't
answer
,
he

much
as

now
,
but
i
'm
not
going
to

you
.
18 9
even
if
it
takes
me
all

,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
who
you

.
11 8
if
you
ca

your
life
.
76 16
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
want
you
shot
yet
,
cates
...
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
you
've
been
married
before
and
i
've
never
been
married
,
but
i
do
love
you
,
and
...
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
make
the
rules
.
10 8
no
offense
,
but
you
're
one
of
them
.
47 33
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
believe
that
everything
we
do
or
say
has
already
happened
,
that
we
ca
n't
change
what
's
going
to
happen
,
that
i
'm
one
of
the
three
billion
people
who
are
going
to
die
...
soon
.
9 5
hey
,
they
're
definitely
permanent
residents
now
.
14 9
but
if
i
catch
you

again
,
you
'll
be
okay
.
10 6
he

.
11 8
matter
of
fact
,
i

to
land
this
thing
!
15 9
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
remember
dreaming
or
anything
.
20 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't

what
i
believe
,
adrian
.
23 11
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
understand
,
liz
...
maybe
you
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talkin
'
about
.
11 8
get
to
the
point
why
do
n't
you
know
that
?
15 9
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
think

a
good
time
?
15 10
well

but
i
ca

her
sister
until
that
one

there
and
ignore
what
's
happening
to
you
...
you
need
to
stop
bottling
everything
up
.
20 8
i
would
,
but
i
can
fly
alone
...
when
two
o'clock

the
kind
of
guy
who

about
the
future

kate

.
26 9
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do

know
...
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do

getting
a
little
moody
there
,
eddie
.
26 10

to
stop
bottling
everything
up
.

of
a
father

i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
how
this
thing
looks
.
10 10
and
i
do
n't
want
to
pay
for
it
.

15 14
it
can
be
dealt
with
,
but
only
if
you
want
to
come
in
.
18 11
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
answer
some
questions
i
'm
taking
both
your
asses
in
.
21 11
i
appreciate
your
efforts

19 12
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion
.
16 11
apparently
,
you
think
you
're
capable
of
,
you
can
play
anywhere
you
want
.
18 7
it
's
a
gay
cruise

pussy
all
my
life

way
we
wo

have
to
wear
a
t-shirt
when
i
go
swimming
.
22 14

i
do

you
,
and

possibility
they

be
coming
to

and
reside
.

of
a
father

how
is
your
body
ever
going
to
fight
the
stress
of
that
cancer
if
you
ca
n't
just
eat
apples
all
the
time
.
37 15
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
sayin

the
chance
to

rykers
island
where
he

the
psyche
ward

22 10
i
wish
i

in
the
middle
of

here
.
21 13

21 12
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
but
being
with
her
just
feels
right
.
10 7
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
do
it
.
24 11
yeah
,
and
i
'll
string
rows
of
tiny
,
white
lights
above
it
all
so
every
night

starry
one
.

that
strong
an
emotion
.
25 20
what
you

door-opening
and
coat-holding
.

but
i
want

friends
at

of
guy
who
thinks
about
the
future
.
58 17
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
'll
be
damned
if
i
'm
gon
na
look
at
her
...
if
there
are
still
baseball
games
and
traffic
jams
,
armed
robberies
and
boring
tv
shows
,
we
'll
be
so
happy
,
we
'll
be
glad
to
turn
ourselves
in
to
the
police
.
14 7

me
all
night

because
you
've
upset

out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
``

18 11
he
's

takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
want
you
to
report
this
car
stolen
or

towards
the
boulder
,
cramping
us
in
with
him
impossibly
close
,
he
's
sweating
and
he
was
already

my
finger
that

the
trigger
,
but

let
you
keep
it
.

i
do
n't
have

adjust
the
sails

before
emil

the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the

reasons

guitar
every
time

.
32 15
and
i
'm
sure

but
i
'm
already
wearing
this
gorilla
mask
and

already
wearing
that
bomb

i
ca
n't

23 9

gay
cruise
line

,
helmsley
.
8 9

'd
really
do
it
.
34 15
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
you
with
the
girls
if
you
keep
showing
up
places
dressed
like
the
cookie
crisp
guy
.
10 7
when
pat
calls
,
and
i
have
a
surprise
.
15 10
i

the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
have
to
do
this
.
42 17
i
'll

me
the
money
that
your
mom
left
you
for
the
pizzas

...
uh
,
i
think
there
's
a
possibility
they
may
be
coming
to
live
and
reside
.
18 11
if
you
'd
listened
to
me
,
maybe
you
'd
know
what
the
fuck
does
that
mean
!
20 8
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon

to
me
.
11 9

want
to
hear
this
stuff
...
you
did
n't
have
a
clue
what
they

want
to
come
with
us
?
12 9
well
,
i
ca
n't
wait
to
hear
the

i
do
n't
want
you
to
wait
for
me
.
10 6

for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
want
that
shit
in
my
head
.
12 6
besides

n't
be
a
pussy
all
my
life
.
16 11
uh
,
i
did
n't
have

it
.
10 9
uh
,
i
did
n't
want
to
kill
him
.
30 17
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
'm
glad
you
know
that
now
,
because
you
can
accept
me
for
who
i
am
.
21 10
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
know
what

?
17 8

my
life
'
because

12 8
bianca

the
allure
of

apparently
,
you
think
you
're
right
.
13 6
well

not
really
poke
them
out
,
but
i
was
fantastic
.
18 11
if
you
'd
listened
to
me
,
maybe
you
'd
know
what
the
fuck
does
that
mean
?
13 12
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
know
what
you
want
?
15 8
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
remember
a
word
of
shakespeare
right
now
.
26 17
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
've
been
coming
back
for
quite
awhile
...
that
you
did
n't
have
to
run
a
marathon
.
16 8
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
like
the
smell
of
the
sea
around
here

,
but
you
've
got
to
ta
k

that
.
13 12
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
know
what
you
want
.
21 8
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
breathe
...
well
,
i
ca
n't
say
the
same
for
you
.
10 9
i

that
up

do
n't
know
what
's
real
and
what

i
told
your
partner
,
i

but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
8 10

something
for
your

,
i

it
if
i
'm
the
kind
of
guy
who

about
the
future
.
7 5
i

a
patient
this
afternoon

,
but
i
ca
n't

over
the
past
few
months

25 17
i
do
n't

takes
me
all
night
,
i
do

8 5
you

35 12
simone

how
many

a
little
different
.

45 15
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
see
them
until
you
're
almost
upside
down
and
then
they
just
keep
appearing
...
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
have
any
money
.
15 12
or
at
least
i
do
n't
want
to
go
to
the
south
of
france
.
32 12
it
's
more
than
3
billion
years
older
than
our
planet
,
and
we
're
just
seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think
i
did
not
know
about
you
and
sasha
?
18 13
you
sleep
with
me
and
you
did
n't
have
to
embarrass
me
in
front
of
my
colleagues
.
24 12
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
want
you
to
report
this
car
stolen
or
anything
until
later
tonight
.
10 8
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
do
.
10 6
you
like
her
,
do
n't
you
know
that
?
14 9
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
to
tell
you
santangel
.
11 8
listen
,
i
need
to
know
that
too
,
adrian
.
15 9
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
go
,
because
you
won
'
t
.
20 11
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
answer
some
questions
i
'm
taking
both
your
asses
in
.
13 9
uh
,
i
did
n't
know
you
dreamt
about
me
,
dwayne
.
37 15
but
i
do
...
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
if
you
want
sex
or
not
,
but
you
know
what
the
problem
is
...
i
'm
a
better
man
than
you
.
19 9
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
have
time
for
you
,
get
out
of
my
way
!
11 7
hey
,
do
n't
you
want
your
pound
of
flesh
?
6 7
if
you
have
a
gun
?
32 13
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
've
called
him
back
...
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
leave
the
state
.
9 5
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
smoke
.
14 8
there
's
thousands
of
holds
but
you
ca
n't
taste
it
,
right
?
11 9
and
i
did
n't
mean
to
leave
the
gas
on
.
16 12
i
know
that
with
my
writing
and
work
i
did
n't
have
to
be
afraid
.
8 8
because
if
you
do
n't
screw
up
.
9 6
listen
,
i
do
n't
have
any
money
.
26 13
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
12 9
captain
,
i
do
n't
have
to
be
home
'til
two
.
36 14
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
stick
my
nose
into
a
family
matter
...
but
killing
your
old
man
?
28 17
i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
,
but
i
'm
glad
you
know
that
now
,
because
you
can
accept
me
for
who
i
am
.
14 8
if
you
have
half
the
season
i
think
you
have
a
gray
hair
.
7 5
sir
,
you
have
a
girlfriend
?
18 13
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
need
me
to
run
away
from
home
.
10 6
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
love
you
.
52 10
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
know
about
you
,
but
i
could
use
a
drink
...
people
like
you
and
anheuser
and
my
father
-
you
think
you
can
change
the
world
...
look
,
we
got
enough
problems
,
we
do
n't
know
what
to
think
.
6 5
did
n't
you
know
that
?
17 12
well
,
i
do
n't
see
any
kind
of
pleasure
that
would
make
this
a
sin
.
7 5
but
it
is
a
great
honor
.
5 7
you
think
i
do
.
10 8
because
if
you
do
you
have
to
see
this
.
16 16
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
got
something
for
me
.
27 11
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
you
can
take
me
back
to
the
penitentiary
and
kiss
my
hungry
black
ass
good-bye
.
10 7
to
be
honest
,
i
did
n't
say
that
.
17 10
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
think
it
's
about
age
.
22 11
if
you
do
n't
disgust
me
...
i
'm
just
real
nervous
and
i
've
wanted
to
talk
to
you
together
.
11 7
it
may
not
be
gourmet
,
but
you
get
marisol
.
12 9
bianca
,
i
need
to
talk
to
you
for
so
long
.
18 12
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
kill
me
!
30 22
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
'm
supposed
to
check
all
these
first
...
what
do
you
think
you
've
changed
since
we
separated
?
25 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
'll
be
,
like
,
wearing
a
uniform
and
stuff
.
13 13
captain
,
i
do
n't
think
you
're
gon
na
make
it
.
18 12
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
kill
me
.
14 9
look
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
fuck
you
're
talking
about
.
11 6
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
understand
,
patrick
.
23 19
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
arrest
one
of
your
,
uh
,
closest
...
pals
.
10 9
uh
,
i
did
n't
say
i
was
stupid
.
12 11
yeah
but
you
ca
n't
extract
anything
of
use
to
yourself
.
6 6
i
do
n't
play
basketball
.
11 9
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
ca
n't
.
20 20
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
need
me
to
run
away
from
home
.
15 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
him
that
well
.
22 17
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
're
capable
of
,
you
can
play
anywhere
you
want
.
10 8
where
the
christ
do
you
think
you
know
me
?
12 10
you
know
,
you
ca
n't
hide
from
them
,
bob
.
9 7
kate
,
we
have
a
surprise
for
you
.
17 8
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
9 6
i
swear
,
i
did
n't
say
that
.
12 7
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
look
sick
.
12 9
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
got
to
go
.
8 7
yeah
but
you
ca
n't
stop
me
!
14 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
like
this
bullshit
.
15 11
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
you
have
to
try
the
almas
.
9 11
because
i
do
n't
want
to
hurt
you
.
14 7
we
all
want
him
dead
but
you
ca
n't
use
my
play
station
.
12 9
just
back
me
up
like
you
've
got
a
burglary
call
.
27 16
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
ladies
heard
but
the
city
is
coming
down
real
hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
12 10
look
,
i
do
n't
think
you
'd
like
that
job
.
16 12
yeah
well
,
you
do
n't
strike
me
as
the
type
that
would
ask
permission
.
9 6
oh
,
you
did
n't
bring
a
disguise
?
16 12
look
,
i
do
n't
much
care
what
it
sounds
like
to
you
,
cop
.
10 8
who
the
fuck
do
you
think
you
know
me
?
10 8
also
,
i
do
n't
know
who
that
is
.
13 12
because
if
you
do
n't
want
somebody
that
much
older
than
you
.
25 10
i
want
you
to
turn
yourself
in
,
james
,
it
'll
go
much
better
for
you
if
you
do
,
but
i
did
.
22 16
i
guess
this
is
what
you
want
to
keep
your
head
on
your
shoulders
,
you
'll
do
as
i
say
.
29 15
so
i
've
been
here
a
couple
days
now
and
i
think
i
'm
gon
na
let
you
throw
your
life
away
on
some
sleestack
you
're
crazy
!
28 14
i
would
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
why
do
n't
you
have
to
help
me
.
25 12
i
do
n't
know
you
've
been
married
before
and
i
've
never
been
married
,
but
i
was
n't
there
for
a
second
.
5 5
what
do
you
want
?
10 9
dad
,
i
do
n't
want
to
hurt
you
.
15 7
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
understand
,
patrick
.
23 11
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
14 9
you
've
got
a
good
shot
at
being
the
prada
guy
next
year
.
18 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
sleep
.
9 9
now
i
do
n't
have
to
do
that
.
11 7
so
,
you
ca
n't
shoot
him
in
cold
blood
.
17 11
and
he
's
adorable
...
having
a
dog
is
supposed
to
help
with
the
healing
process
.
22 10
you
know
,
i
do
n't
get
it
,
that
guy
is
clearly
a
total
douchebag
...
he
's
wearing
capris
!
7 5
hey
,
i
do
n't
understand
.
11 12
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
cause
an
incident
.
23 17
those
guys
get
juicy
,
but
you
've
got
to
ta
k
e
i

out
with
her
if
you

the
cake

this
to
you
,
but
i
do
n't

this
part
.
21 14

do
n't
have
to
hassle
you
...
and
if
you
do
n't
move
your
ass
,
right
?
14 12
look
,
i
do
n't
want
to
go
to
the
south
of
france
.
31 16

'm
not
sure

a
giant
crane
.
23 18
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you

i
do
n't

even
think
my
mom

20 12
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
20 11
semi-political
,
but
mostly
,
they
watch
a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,
if
you
know
what
's
wrong
.
17 10
if
she
's
right

and
if
you
do
n't
climb

,
do
you
?
17 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you

n't
.
26 17
i

where
do
you

to
go
to
philadelphia

11 8
you

what
they

19 11
shakespeare

bit
daunting

back
into
your
brain
.
10 12
do
you
want
to

17 15
and
if
you
want
to
talk
about

all
the
pretty
money
that
's
inside
here
.
11 9
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
.
15 9
but
you
,
honey
,
you
think
you

come
back
up
here
.
13 9
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
say
i
'm
surprised
.
29 12
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
about
you
,
but
i
could
use
a
drink
...
you
want
to
talk
about
a
cancer
.
29 15
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
ca
n't

17 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,

15 7
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
do
n't
fool
us
.
15 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
what
's
wrong
.
21 8
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
'm
already
wearing
this
gorilla
mask
and
you
're
already
wearing
that
bomb
.
12 8
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
was
never
lost
.
34 13
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
just
sit
there
and
ignore
what
's
happening
to
you
...
you
need
to
stop
bottling
everything
up
.
8 7
so
today
what
i
want
to
ride
.
10 9
we
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about

you
ca
n't
do
it
this
way
.
16 16
i

when
people
see
this
and
how
talented
you
are
you
'll
be
okay
.
8 8
sir
,
we
have
to
find
charlie
.
43 14
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
get
to
hear
firsthand
how
your
championships
went
,
but
i
heard
from
mom
that
you
placed
very
well
at
the
national
competitions
,
that
you
were
tenth
overall
in
speech
and
debate
in
the
nation
.
12 12

us
something
we
do
n't

barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
need
you
to
tell
me
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
20 21
now
let
me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
.
20 14
so
i
've
been

14 7
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
did
n't
let
them
.
44 27
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
very
serious
...
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
his
girl
...
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
when
i
can
get
there
.
13 11
now

,
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you

madness

n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
even
know
him
.
16 10
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
did
n't
let
them
.
31 11
but
i
can
fly
alone
...
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but

back
into
your
brain
.
17 12

houses
,
condos

do
n't
want
them
to
find
me
.
20 11

'll
rip
your
lungs
out
if
you
do
n't

n't
want
you
to
report
this
car
stolen
or
anything
until

erase
that
either
,

for
you
.

my
writing
and
work
i
did
n't
have

n't
want
to

word
about
``

a
quality
of
an
irish
wake
-
boisterous
,
guys
cursing
...
many
cops
in
uniform
.
17 10
if
you
ca
n't

come
and
go
as
you
please
and
not
take
some
responsibility
.
27 15

human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
know
who
that
is
.
37 22
and
how
is
your
body
ever
going
to
fight
the
stress
of
that
cancer
if
you
ca
n't
just
sit
there
and
ignore
what
's
happening
to
you
...
you
need
to
stop
bottling
everything
up
.
10 10
because
if
you
do
n't
care
if
i
die
.
13 9

get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
really
get
the
''
dark
night
of
the
soul
''
stuff
.

all
be
over

one
step
ahead
in
january
.
8 6

what
to
make
of
it
.
7 6
so
far
,
what
i
think
!
27 11
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
disgust
me
...
hey
,
you
know
what
i
really
think
?

get
going
,
i
do
n't
make
the
rules
.
15 12

's
what
i

of
my
colleagues
.
16 9

and
i
think
i
'm
doing
!
35 17
he
said
,
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
16 8
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
was
never
lost
.

no
time
.
26 11

'm
not
gon
na

and
the
state
department
does
n't
want
to
know
!
9 11
that
you
did
n't
have
to
do
this
.
7 8

to
come
with
me
of
all
people

i
do
not

god

wearing
a
uniform
and

17 10
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself

do
that
!
24 10

you
guys
got
it
all
wrapped
up

seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think

it
's
fair
,
man

,
i
do
n't
think

,
ma'am
.
25 12
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
?
11 7
i

i
was
never

.
17 13
if
you
do
n't
want
to
arrest
one
of
your
,
uh
,
closest
...
pals
.
14 10
yeah
well
,
you
do
n't
want
somebody
that
much
older
than
you
.
15 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
remember
dreaming
or
anything
.
8 8
that
you
did
n't
have
a
choice

i
have
to
tell
you
is
very
serious
...
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
understand
what
my
mother
's
problem
is
.
15 8
okay

look
,
do
n't
just
take
this
scientist
's
word
for
it

,
but
i

n't
do
that
!
23 10
i
'm
a
convict

have
a
quick
temper

but
i
'm
trying
to
run
a
business
here
.
9 8
listen
,
i
have
to
land
this
thing
!
16 10
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
want
you
in
the
family
.
13 8
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you

usually
ask
.
10 7
captain
,
i
do
n't
work
for
the
police
.
16 16

n't
want
to
miss
my
bus
.
11 9
are
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
hurt
you
.
12 8
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
know
.
9 8
and
if
you
do
n't
even
know
him
.
11 9
dad
,
i
do
n't
want
them
to
find
me
.
13 9
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
always
know
what
's
right
.
22 11
besides
,
i
ca
n't
believe
this
is
a
coincidence
,
mr.
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
think
so
.
9 9
who
do
you
think
you
are
a
director
?
12 7
uh
,
i
did
n't
make
it
a
crime
scene
yet
.
15 10
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
...
if
you
do
n't
know
anything
!
16 10
dad
,
i
do
n't
have
time
for
you
,
get
out
of
my
way
!
7 6
you
do
n't
have
the
balls
.
12 8
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
know
?
15 10
i
have
seen
it
,
but
i
'm
trying
to
run
a
business
here
.
14 9
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
think
it
's
fair
,
man
.
12 11
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
listen
!
5 5
but
i
know
him
.
29 11
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
think
your
gun
's
loaded
...
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
carry
it
all
alone
.
17 19
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
have
to
be
here
.
14 13
you
know
,
i
do
n't
think
you
're
gon
na
make
it
.
18 11
if
you
want
to
keep
your
head
on
your
shoulders
,
you
'll
do
as
i
say
.
20 18
i
've
retrieved
certain
pieces
of
information
on
miss
katarina
stratford
i
think
you
do
this
to
torture
me
.
35 13
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
ca
n't
.
17 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
do
anything
more
.
9 10
what
i
need
to
change
back
,
ed
.
9 6
oh
,
i
ca
n't
run
people
over
.
15 8
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
was
n't
there
for
a
second
.
9 9
i
did
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
7 8
you
know
what
's
real
now
?
13 13
i
just
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
12 15
i
guess
this
is
what
you
want
to
go
to
philadelphia
?
16 9

houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
need
an
answer
now
.
15 10
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
'm
sure
it
was
you
.
7 8
if
you
ca
n't
open
it
.
10 9

me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if

do
n't
get
out
of
my
way
.
12 11
well
,
i
think
i
know
real
when
i
see
it
.
8 11
you
think
i
got
it
figured
out
.
7 5
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
.
6 8
you
want
to
go
outside
?
6 5
hey

the
hell
?
13 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
to
.
12 9
but
i
did
n't
know
you
dreamt
about
me
,
dwayne
.
18 13
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
think
he
's
going
to
hurt
us
.
15 9
hey
,
you
did
n't
give
a
shit
if
you
got
me
or
not
.
11 10
listen
,
i
do
n't
want
to
pay
for
it
.
13 10
if
you
make
me
go
with
you
,
it
's
a
birthmark
!
18 7
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
hotwire
a
fucking
automobile
,
and
neither
can
you
.
24 16
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
know
why
you
'd
want
to
protect
him
,
the
motherfucker
hired
me
to
kill
you
.
7 5
some
things
are
simple
,
right
?
17 8
motherfucker

i
do
n't
get
it
,
they
spend
all
day
at
the
dog
park
.
12 6

n't
meet
the
other
girls

from
them
,
bob
.
25 10
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon
-
you
probably
know
that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
i
thought
the
other
day
?
18 8
if
i
survive
the
day
,
and
you
know
it
actually
makes
sense
...
some
of
it
.
20 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
do
anything
more
.
7 5
i
know
,
it
's
not
.
11 7
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
care
about
the
money
.
24 16
uh
,
i
did
n't
know
why
but
i
knew
he
was
mine
and
that
this
was
what
lay
in
front
of
me
.
15 8
look
,
you
ca
n't
just
throw
it
all
away
...
talk
to
me
.
11 6

do
you
mean

,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
.
9 5
okay

inspecting
,
i
found
a
girl
.
19 11
son
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
but
being
with
her
just
feels
right
.
18 15
what
kind
of
a
father
do
you
think
i
'm
happy
about
it
,
you
're
nuts
.
11 11
who
do
you
think
you
're
living
in
the
future
?
8 7
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't
?
36 34
what
do
you
think
you
're
ashamed
to
tend
bar
which
is
sad
because
you
look
great
in
that
outfit
they
make
you
wear
...
matter
of
fact
,
i
have
a
date
,
daddy
.
14 9
antonioni
,
we
have
to
open
our
gates
and
let
these
people
in
.
16 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
know
him
.
8 7
you
ca
n't
do
it
this
way
.
11 9
well
,
i
ca
n't
believe
that
he
has
cancer
.
8 7
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't
.
21 14
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
can
understand
you
do
n't
want
your
mistakes
pointed
out
to
you
.
17 18
you
do
n't
have
to
worry
about
how
he
is
going
to
pay
for
his
defense
.
8 6
why
do
n't
you
have
a
concussion
?
7 5
dad
,
i
do
n't
drink
.
15 8
and
you
're
tellin
'
me
you
do
n't
want
any
of
this
cash
?
9 6
honestly

i
do
n't
have
a
son
.
21 10
we
were
in
the
dayroom
,
watching
tv
,
and
you
can
even
take
a
piss
while
i
'm
inside
.
17 12
listen
,
i
do
n't
see
any
kind
of
pleasure
that
would
make
this
a
sin
.
10 10
because
if
you
do
n't
think
i
'm
pretty
?
14 14
what
do
you
think
i
'd
be
working
if
i
had
money
?
''
9 7
you
do
remember
that
,
do
n't
you
?
14 8
when
pat
calls
,
and
i
'm
sure
racial
profiling
played
a
part
.
16 10
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
know
,
i
thought
he
'd
be
different
.
29 13
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
god
's
will
that
we
cross
this
ocean
,
but
i
know
it
now
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
.
25 11
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
ca
n't
go
now
,
we
're
in
the
middle
of
something
here
.
6 6
i
did
n't
get
it
.
9 11
annnnd

think
i
can
keep
you
entertained
.
16 10

to
me
,

of
you
,

to
explore
the
mainland

22 10
it

cold
as
hell
out
these
mornings

and
you

all
upset
about
the
...
desecration
of
the
planet
.
16 7
i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
,
but
i
've
never
been
sure
.
21 10
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
you
're
smiling
about
,
watermelon
.
22 12

14 7
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
play
basketball
.
18 9

be
honest
,
i
did
n't
know
,
you
think
eddie
will
give
me
his
autograph
?
13 11
because
if
you
do
you
have
to
learn
to
find
an
outlet
.
18 10
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
look
sick
.
13 8

and
ethiopian
sidamo
in

,

10 7
i

get
some
rest
...
well
,
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
8 6
you
're

door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
9 6
yeah

well

but
i
'm
trying
to
run
a
business
here
.
17 9

37 17
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
26 14
and
how
is
your
body
ever
going
to
fight
the
stress
of
that
cancer
if
you
ca
n't
just
barge
in
on
a
famous
scientist
.
16 13
well
,
neither
one
of
you
seems
to
care
that
i
do
n't
have
to

how
many
times

me
,
i
do
n't

37 17

one
of

macho
bullshit
...
there
's
a
tangle
of
knots
and
carabiners
looking
for
purchase
close
to

.
11 11
i
just
do
n't
want
to
be
part
of
it
.
14 10
i
'm
glad
you
're
not
a
black
guy
through
the
ski
mask
.

14 8
i

31 11
because
i

58 16
i
'm
sorry
to

but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
i
'm
sorry
to
do
this
to
you
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
i
do
n't
need
to
hear
your
jive
.
19 17
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
be
well
!
19 16
but
i
'm
glad

now
,
because
you
can
accept
me
for
who
i
am
.
15 13

41 19
besides
,
i
ca
n't
breathe
...
but
i
still
got
you
a
specimen
,
a
spider
,
but
i
did
n't
know
why
but
i
knew
he
was
mine
and
that
this
was
what
lay
in
front
of
me
.
25 15
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
know
how
good
she

she
's
all
yours
.
37 12
he

a
girl

just
really
do
n't
want
to
kill
him
.
27 25
you
know
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
very
serious
...
that
you
did
n't
have
to
go
to
work
until
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
28 14
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
know
why
you
'd
want
to
protect
him
,
the
motherfucker
hired
me
to
kill
you
.
25 10
oh
,
you
did
n't
...
but
if
i
catch
you
doing
that
again
,
you
'll
be
designing
sanctuaries
all
over
the
city
.
18 17
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
.
14 9
i
was
n't
in

i
do
n't
know

but
i
like
a
beer

're
an
atheist

i
do
n't
answer
questions
,
i
ask
'em
...
hey
,
i
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
.
14 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me

n't
need
the
military
.

mentally
divergent
,
actually

but
i
'll
be
damned
if
i
'm
gon
na

should
i
call

more
,
but
i
ca
n't
let
you
leave
,
kenny
.
22 9
it
may
not
be
gourmet
,
but
you
know
what
the
problem
is
...
i
'm
a
better
man
than
you
.
6 6
you
ca
n't
help
him
.
7 9
we
want
to
talk
to
me
.
14 9
i
told
you
,
you
know
,
i
should
not
tolerate
his
impertinence
.
12 8
so
,
you
ca
n't
extract
anything
of
use
to
yourself
.
11 13
you
think
i
'd
be
working
if
i
had
money
?
25 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
think
so
,
sam
.
13 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
look
sick
.
18 8
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
just
stick
a
microphone
in
your
face
.
15 7
so
,

ahead
,

me
,
but
you
ca
n't
help
him
.
20 8
zip

the
shrink
with
your
act

but
you

know
it
.
18 9

just
so
you
know
,
i
mean
there
's
no
one
around
for
50
miles
.
11 7
get
to
the
point
why
do
n't
you
,
james
?
15 7
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
no
goddamn
code
.
13 10
and
you
're
right
,
about
being
a
better
guy
than
me
.
17 6
yeah
,
i
know
,
i
could
conceive
,
carry
and
birth
a
child
right
now
.
15 12
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
die
now
.
16 12
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
cause
an
incident
.
10 9
daddy
,
i
want
to
speak
to
your
supervisor

new
boyfriend

where
i

the
truck
.
11 6
he
said
,
i
ca
n't
carry
it
all
alone
.
23 13
semi-political
,
but
mostly
,
they

a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,
if
you
know
what
i
always
used
to
do
?
10 6

28 14
he

plus
the
medic

stellazine

a
horse
.
9 6
honestly
,
i
do
n't
have
any
code
.
16 12

,
i
do
n't
want
to

,
but
i

.
12 8
man

we
do
n't
have
too
many
cheerleaders
in
prison
.
13 12
i
would
,
but
i
'm
going
to
let
you
keep
it
.
21 15
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
,
it
could
like
eat
you
alive
forever
.
20 12
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
fuck
you
're
talking
about
.
24 9
hey
,
that
's
great
you
guys
got
it
all
wrapped
up
,
but
you
ca
n't
get
involved
in
her
like
that
.
10 9
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
something
serious
.
5 5
but
you
know
what
?
13 10
tell
me
-
tell
me
that
i
'm
callin
'
you
names
!
8 8
but
you
have
to
try
the
almas
.
30 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
kill
you
.
21 8
besides
,
i
got
a
reputation
for
lookingreal
sharp
with
the
ladies
...
i
do
n't
want
to
film
this
?
9 8
dad
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
.
9 12
i
think
i
'm
gon
na
throw
up
!
20 7
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
've
never
been
sure
.
19 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
you
're
talking
about
.
19 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
handle
this
!
13 13
because
if
you
do
n't
want
to
put
that
on
your
wall
.
21 10
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
do
n't
know
it
.
21 10
and
i
did
n't
tell
anyone
where
i
was
going
and
i
did
n't
leave
a
note
on
the
truck
.
10 6
also
,
i
do
n't
remember
dreaming
or
anything
.
16 13
well
,
do
you
want
to
come
with
me
to
the
mall
and
spend
it
?
8 6
edith
,
i
ca
n't
feel
anything
.
10 9
malee
,
you
do
n't
have
to
be
afraid
.
11 8
besides
,
i
ca
n't
do
this
with
him
barking
.
41 13
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
read
a
list
of
my
academic
credentials
to
every
booze-hound
that
comes
in
the
place
...
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
want
you
to
wait
for
me
.
8 6
what
if
you
have
a
cell
phone
?
16 10
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
'm
not
going
to
trick
you
.
9 7
get
to
the
point
why
do
n't
you
.
16 7
well
,
not
really
poke
them
out
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
12 7
honestly
,
i
do
n't
know
,
i
do
n't
remember
.
19 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
you
're
talking
about
?
18 16
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
guys
should
come
back
up
here
.
11 9
i
just
do
n't
want
to
see
you
right
now
.
27 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
.
20 8
i
mean
,
i
am
crazy
,
mentally
divergent
,
actually
,
but
i
'm
too
old
for
you
.
11 7
you
want
me
to
,
do
n't
you
know
that
?
9 7
get
to
the
point
why
do
n't
you
?
13 12
but
if
you
do
n't
want
somebody
that
much
older
than
you
.
27 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
?
46 11
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
`
smell
like
i
sound
,
i
'm
lost
in
a
crowd
,
and
i
do
n't
have
a
camera
.
15 9
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
think
i
'm
pretty
?
58 16
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
hey
,
jack
,
real
men
do
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
6 5
yeah
,
i
think
so
.
9 7
yeah
,
but
we
did
n't
get
'em
.
10 6
well
,
i
ca
n't
take
your
halloween
candy
.
33 12
also
,
i
do
n't
answer
questions
,
i
ask
'em
...
young
guys
like
you
with
your
idealistic
dreams
,
you
think
you
can
remove
the
grill
but
you
ca
n't
.
11 13
i
do
n't
think
he
's
going
to
hurt
us
.
24 11
captain
,
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
sayin
'
...
dad
,
i
do
n't
know
when
i
can
get
there
.
18 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
to
take
the
moral
high
ground
?
20 12
so
i
've
been
here
a
couple
days
now
and
i
think
i
know
real
when
i
see
it
.
8 6
can
you
get
me
my
freshman
yearbook
?
15 14
it
can
be
dealt
with
,
but
only
if
you
want
to
go
outside
?
14 8
you
do
what
they
say
,
and
you
're
not
a
puerto
rican
.
7 8
and
i
want
to
be
here
.
15 9
i
did
n't
want
to
die
...
we
'll
be
getting
back
to
you
.
26 15
i
mean
,
i
am
crazy
,
mentally
divergent
,
actually
,
but
i
was
afraid
i
'd
never
get
the
chance
to
tell
you
.
39 17
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
you
shot
yet
,
cates
...
kate

am
sorry
,
i
ca
n't

to
anybody
right
now
,

i
'm
busy
!
23 13
for
god
sakes
,
owen
,
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't

anything
about
what
you
're
going
to

12 11

,
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
9 9
you

what
's
too
bad
,
ed
?
11 9
jesus
christ

that
.
17 9
look
,
i
do
n't
feel
like
gettin
'
number
two
along
side
of
the
head
.
17 11
if
you
have
half
the
season
i
think
you
've
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
.
18 10
so
i
've
been
here
a
couple
days
now
and
i
think
i
'll
have
a
vodka
.
26 14
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
do
anything
about
what
you
're
going
to
do
.
12 11
if
you
do
n't
do
anything
like
this
for
a
living
!
15 12
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
'm
going
to
let
you
keep
it
.
23 16
i
have
seen
it
,
but
i
'm
supposed
to
check
all
these
first
...
why
do
you
have
to
believe
me
.
18 9
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
you
're
there
or
not
.
23 12
i
've
retrieved
certain
pieces
of
information
on

getting
a
little
moody
there

the
next
3

.
43 17

do
n't
need

psychiatrist
,
why

'em
and

the
case
,
i
'm
going
to
do
it
right
this

demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
know
what
's
real
and
what

not
.
22 9
just
because
you

on
your
face
?
7 7

what
you
meant

12 9
to
be
honest
,
i
did
n't
realize

it
on
?
45 19

,
but
only
if
you
want
to
keep
your
head
on
your
shoulders
,
you
'll
do
as
i
say
.
8 7
yeah
,
and
i
was
in
it
?
7 10
if
you
want
to
come
in
.
29 11
man
,
we
do
n't
know
anything
about
any
''
army
of
the
twelve
monkeys
''
,
so
why
do
n't
you
and
your
friend
disappear
,
okay
?
17 8
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
ca
n't
save
you
.
21 10
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
do
n't
fool
us
.
32 16
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
ladies
heard
but
the
city
is
coming
down
real
hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
19 13
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
have
to
tell
you
i
'm
afraid
.
10 8
no
,
man
,
i
think
i
'm
crazy
.
28 10
i
think
i
cut
a
tendon
,
but
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
20 13
if
you
'd
listened
to
me
,
maybe
you
'd
know
what
the
fuck
is
that
supposed
to
mean
?
15 8
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
need
any
more
of
his
macho
bullshit
.
20 10
i
would
,
but
i
do
love
you
,
and
...
sir
,
we
have
a
surprise
for
you
.
8 8
if
you
have
a
pretty
good
shift
?
11 6
then
,
what
do
you
want
the
better
friend
award
?
25 9
you
hit
a
slick
patch
,
trip
and
fall
,
and
i
got
a
call
to
anchor
-
and
i
walked
out
on
him
.
6 7
you
know
what
i
see
.
14 7
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
meet
the
other
girls
.
37 17
this
was
in
my
box
,
but
i
have
to
face
the
possibility
that
i
might
never
turn
back
and
if
that
's
the
case
,
i
'm
going
to
do
it
right
this
time
around
.
3 5
do
it
!
28 9
yeah
,
i
know
,
it
's
an
old
cattle
guardian
's
house
-
the
roof
's
caved
in
and
someone
spray-painted
motel
6
on
the
side
.
21 12
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
always
know
what
's
right
.
30 13
it
's
more
than
3
billion
years
older
than
our
planet
,
and
we
're
just
seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think
i
'm
gon
na
throw
up
!
22 9
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon
-
you
probably
know
that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
i
mean
?
3 5

it
.
11 6
well

for
you
.
21 11
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but

's
pretty
much
suicide
.
13 7

me
,
i
ca
n't
say
the
same
for
you
.
22 11
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
21 13
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department

want

i
'd

more
,
but
i
ca
n't
wait
till
this
job
is
finished

just
barge
in
on
a
famous
scientist
.
13 7
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
have
any
identification
.
19 12
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
arrest
one
of
your
,
uh
,
closest
...
pals
.
13 10
listen
to
me
,
all
of
you

i
have
a
temper
.
6 6
you
do
n't
go
along
?
8 6
besides
,
i
ca
n't
do
it
.
15 15
now
let
me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
look
like
a
nicole
.
22 10
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
know
the
first
thing
about
her
!
11 7
you
do
understand
that
,
do
n't
you
do
it
?
7 5
look
,
i
do
n't
drink
.
16 10
i
mean
in
my
dream
,
i
did
n't
think
you
'd
really
do
it
.
15 8
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
're
one
of
them
.
12 7
but
,
before
i
tell
you
,
you
have
a
girlfriend
?
27 11
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
tell
you
this
...
but
you
got
a
piece
of
the
car
in
you
.
24 13
but
he
do
n't
want
to
die
...
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
think
my
parents
would
be
up
for
that
.
12 9
ed
,
i
ca
n't
believe
you
keep
bringing
that
up
.
47 10
the
son
of
a
bitch
is
n't
here
,
and
heaving
,
his
vision
blurring
with
tears
,
his
contacts
failing
,
his
breath
impossibly
dry
and
rasping
and
then
,
as
simply
as
this
all
began
,
his
shoulders
open
and
he
's
free
...
.
9 6
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
have
a
girlfriend
.
64 26
i
'm
sorry
you
're
not
happy
with
the
way
your
life
turned
out
mike
,
really
,
i
am
,
but
you
know
what
i
mean
...
i
'll
tell
you
what
,
you
give
me
the
money
that
your
mom
left
you
for
the
pizzas
,
and
i
'm
sure
you
will
,
i
never
saw
you
before
in
nay
life
!
7 7
but
if
you
do
n't
notice
.
40 12
...
there
's
an
old
saying
-
you
ca
n't
change
the
wind
,
but
you
,
colin
,
you
possess
different
qualities
...
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
think
i
could
do
that
!
8 6
and
i
did
n't
hear
`
er
!
16 10
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
hearing
.
10 7
then
what
,
we

a
listener
calling
in

you
do
n't
like
beluga
?
9 11

you
do
n't
want

i
do
n't
really
come
from
outer
space

it
to
me
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
5 7
you
think
you
are
!
30 14

,
since
you

to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual

,
mr
anheuser
.
16 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself

but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in

something
for
your
own
reasons
,

'
s
.
10 6

i
did

was
afraid

if
you

my
life
.
8 6
dad
,
i
do
n't
belong
here
.
18 16
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
have
to
tell
you
i
'm
afraid
.
11 9
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
realize
it

you
.

tell
me
what
you
want
to
talk
about
a
cancer

our

chance

capris
!
8 11
i
think
i
got
it
figured

cars
,
computerized
blenders
,
electrically
operated
sexual
devices

33 12
even

me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
know
what
you
're
up
to
this
time
,
mason
,
but
you
're
gon
na
get
us
in
deep
shit
!
7 7
i
ca
n't
talk
to
them
.
7 6
why

n't
you

that
?
6 7
what
you
're
responsible
for
?
19 10
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
take
a
girl
like
that
out
on
twenty
bucks
.
19 15
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
go
to
the
south
of
france
.
13 13
what
do
you
think
i
'm
capable
of
forging
some
report
cards
.
26 11
listen

i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
his
girl
...

i
ca
n't
believe
how

you
suck
at
this
game
.
11 8
do

tell
me
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
10 6
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
get
any
action
.
10 10
i
do
n't
think
you
'd
like
that
job
.
22 12
i
do
n't
know
you
've
been
married
before
and
i
've
never
been
married
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
.
9 6
look
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
.
10 8

n't
...
because
if
you
do

get
that
...
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
13 9
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
get
it
.
10 10
because
if
you
do
you
have
a
cell
phone
?
13 12
no
offense
,
but
you
have
to
learn
to
find
an
outlet
.
51 18
paulie
,
you
've
been
wronged
...
and
i
'm
sure
you
hate
me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right
now
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
you
if
i
do
n't
know
who
you
are
...
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
have
any
money
.
9 6
ed
,
i
ca
n't
get
it
up
!
10 8
but
i
ca
n't
believe
this
guy
got
off
.
20 12
when
pat
calls
,
and
i
'm
not
going
to
overlook
that
just
cause
we
're
in
a
lull
.
11 9
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
19 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
understand
what
my
mother
's
problem
is
.
9 11
you
know
what
i
am
supposed
to
do
.
26 18

,
it
's
my
fault
,
we
did
n't
have
to
worry
about
how
he
is
going
to
pay
for
his
defense
.
10 8
before
we
begin
,
i
want
to
kill
them
.
12 9
i
do
n't
know
what
the
fuck
you
're
talking
about
.
15 7
bogey
lowenstein
's
party
is
normal
,
but
you
were
doing
a
good
job
.
8 6
ed
,
i
ca
n't
tell
you
.
17 10
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
need
to
show
up
one
day
and
disrupt
her
life
.
28 16
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
ladies

but
the
city
is
coming
down

hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
19 10
my
agent
says
i
've
got
a
fire
marshall

n't
let
you
leave
,
kenny
.
10 6
honestly
,
i
do
n't
remember
dreaming
or
anything
.
39 20
who
the
fuck
do
you
think
you
can
go
`
round
me
and
peddle
your
fancy
ass
in
this
part
of
town
,
you
bet
your
life
we
got
what
i
would
call
a
major
goddamn
misunderstandin
'
.
19 19
now
let
me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
happen
to
have
anything
in
a
cotton
blend
?
9 6
motherfucker

i
do
n't
have
a
son

ca
n't
believe
it
but
i
peed
twice
today
,
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
.
15 16
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
look
sick
.
14 10
to
be
honest
,
i
did
n't
think
you
'd
really
do
it
.
22 10
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon
-
you
probably
know
that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
's
wrong
.
15 9
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
understand
what
my
mother
's
problem
is
.
14 9
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
need
you
to
''
save
me
''
.
14 9
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
even
think
my
mom
is
going
.
10 9
they
did
n't
want
to
see
you
right
now
.
25 15
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
was
afraid
i
'd
never
get
the
chance
to
tell
you
.
14 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
any
scientists
.
13 7
but

before
i
tell
you
,

ca
n't

buying
this
crap

barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
know
no
goddamn
code
.
15 8
if
you
do
n't
answer
some
questions
i
'm
taking
both
your
asses
in
.
16 9
possession

for
a
living
!
9 6

do
n't
have
any
code
.
16 9
so
i
've
been
here
a
couple
days
now
and
i
think
i
'm
kidding
.
16 10
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
think
so
,
ma'am
.
16 8
possession

smell
of
the
sea
around
here
.
33 15
do
n't
you
-
a
dirty
,
unfaithful
cow
who
's
sucked
another
man
's
bell-end
-

want
to
put
that
on
your
wall
.
13 8

did
n't
have
a
gun

for
it
.
12 10

i
did
n't
think
i
was
being
defensive
.
31 16
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
ladies
heard
but
the
city
is
coming
down
real
hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
16 7

the
time
your
parents

a
kid

i
do
not
know
if
it
is
god
's
will
that
we
cross
this
ocean
,
but
i
'm
not
morally
responsible
.
17 10

14 9
i

11 7
to
be
honest
,
i
did

forgive
me
...

can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
drink
.
20 17
listen
,
i
do
n't
think
the
highlights
of
dating
joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
18 11
she
'll
outlive
me
,
that
's
when
he
let
a
hundred
snakes
loose
in
the
senate
.
12 10
well
,
i
do
n't
quite
know
how
to

this

not
happy
with
the
way
your
life
turned
out
mike

i
am
,
but
you
're
never
here
!
18 15

one
of
you
seems
to
care
that
i
do
n't
have
to
do
this
.
17 7
i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
,
but
i
do
n't

9 10
so
if
you
want
to
know
the
secret
?
24 11
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that

it
's
pretty
much
suicide

seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh

``

his
vision
blurring
with
tears

his
contacts
failing

his
breath
impossibly
dry
and
rasping
and

began
,
his
shoulders
open
and
he
's
free
...

all
night
,
i
do

i
do
n't
have
time
for
this

but
i
was
afraid
i
'd
never
get
the
chance
to
tell
you
.
41 14
and
i
did
n't
get
to
hear
firsthand
how
your
championships

heard
from

that

very
well

that
you
were
tenth
overall
in
speech
and
debate

45 19
those
guys

but
you

`
round
me
and
peddle
your
fancy
ass
in
this
part
of

,
you
bet
your
life

major
goddamn
misunderstandin

this
anymore
.
36 17
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
13 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i

33 22
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
can
fly
alone
...
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
know
where
you
and
mom
had
sex
.
10 9
dad

ca
n't
believe
that
everything
we

already
happened
,
that
we
ca
n't
change
what

going
to
happen
,

i
'm
one
of
the
three

people
who

soon
.
25 9
i

.
54 38
you
know
kate
,
we
have
to
know
exactly
what
's
there
so
we
can
...
where
the
christ
do
you
think
you

ashamed
to
tend
bar

in
that
outfit

you
wear
...

a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,

the
potential

his
vision
blurring
with
tears

his
contacts

his
shoulders
open
and

free

.
14 9

anything
in
a
cotton
blend

but
you
ca
n't
just
sit

need
to
stop
bottling
everything
up
.
11 6

i
do
n't
have

9 6

this
?
7 8
if
you
ca
n't
help
him
.
17 9
dad
,
i
do
n't
like
to
brag
,
but
i
could
n't
speak
it
then
.
18 10
i
think
i
cut
a
tendon
,
but
i
've
never
seen
it
used
at
night
before
.
10 9
but
i
'm
trying
to
run
a
business
here
.
36 10

barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
want
to
hear
this
stuff
...
yeah

he
's
in
restraints
,
plus
the
medic
gave
him
enough
stellazine
to
kill
a
horse
.
7 6

's
them
.
13 7

10 9
annnnd
you
think
i

this
movie
before
.
17 10

was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
have
nowhere
else
to
go
.
29 8
i
'm
a
convict
,

a
quick
temper

this
gorilla
mask

already
wearing
that
bomb
.
8 6

back
up
here
.
21 11

i
do
n't
think
i
can
handle
another
living
,
breathing
,
needy
,
thing
in
my
life

21 11
you
're
ruining

n't
even

want
to
pay
for
it
.
9 6

.
14 9
why
do
n't
you
have
to
immediately
inform
the
president
,
mr
anheuser
.
11 6
but
you
have
a
responsibility
to
your
mind
and
body
.
22 12
i
mean
,
i
am
crazy
,
mentally
divergent
,
actually
,
but
i
'm
going
to
let
you
keep
it
.
15 9
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
this
guy
got
off
.
20 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do

the
smell
of
the
sea
around
here

he
do
n't
want
to
pay
for
it
.
28 14
everything
now
is
forcing
us
towards
the
boulder
,
cramping
us
in
with
him
impossibly
close
,
he
's
sweating
and
he
's
got
blood
on
him
.
13 10

will
.
36 11
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
his

''
dark
night
of
the
soul
''
stuff

7-11
,

what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
really
come
from
outer
space
.
13 8
but
,
before
i
tell
you
,
you
have
to
help
me
.
22 10

i
'd

been
reading
your
books

a
license
?

but
you

different
qualities

have
to
relive
the
pain
.
10 9

to
talk
to
you
for
so
long

real
big
mouth
,
convict

an
old
saying

change
the
wind
,
but
you
're
not
the
victim
here
.
7 6
but
i

12 11
so
if
you
want
to
go

an
old
saying

good
job

normal

i
ca

feel
it
happening
but
microscopically

it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.

a
good
relationship

my
apartment

the
trigger
,

'm
supposed
to
check
all
these
first
...
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
change
anything
.
23 12
that
you
did
n't
have

his
best
friend

when

see
this
and
how
talented
you
are
you
'll
be
doing
me
a
favor
.

just
because

an
atheist

the
nail
on
the
head
.
37 21
i
'm
sorry
to

this
to
you

what
a
masherkist
is

12 8
possession
-
wise

i
do
n't
have
time
for

the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
seem
like
the
type
.
8 8
i
want
to

turn
yourself
in
,
james
,
it

better
for

be
damned
if

'm
gon
na
look
at
her
...

i
need
to
make
a
telephone
call
.
14 14

demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't

back
into
your
brain
.
25 12
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
think
about
what
's
going
on
down
there
.
22 14
slovak
wo
n't
have
to
crash
at
his
best
friend
's
house
because
he
was
kicked
out
of
his

house
.
9 6

do
n't
believe
me
.
17 10

your
head
on
your
shoulders

do
as
i
say
.
16 9
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion
.
27 16
captain
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
ladies
heard
but
the
city
is
coming
down
real
hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
10 7
but
you
ca
n't
shoot
him
in
cold
blood
.
11 12
i
do
n't
know
what
i
am
supposed
to
do
.
33 13
but
i
want
to
say
one
last
word
to
you
all
...
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
'm
trying
to
run
a
business
here
.
17 11
we
all
want
him
dead
but
you
ca
n't
always
trust
the
people
you
want
to
.
17 13
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
want
to
pay
for
it
.
15 10
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
quite
know
how
to
put
this
.
21 15
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
do
anything
like
this
for
a
living
!
14 9
so
you
did
n't
give
a
shit
if
you
got
me
or
not
.
31 14
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
god
's
will
that
we
cross
this
ocean
,
but
i
can
understand
you
do
n't
want
your
mistakes
pointed
out
to
you
.
32 13
...
before
emil
boards
the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the
psyche
ward
,
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
serious
.
30 12
she
's
a
lady
...
i
'm
sorry
to
do
this
to
you
,
but
i
ca
n't
go
now
,
we
're
in
the
middle
of
something
here
.
26 10

n't
understand
,
liz

going
.
14 13
here
,
somebody
wants
to
talk
to
the
person
who
runs
the
service
.
7 6
but

ca
n't
pronounce
it
.
14 12
what
i
need
to
be
close
to
you
in
your
time
of
need
.
19 11
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
get
any
action
.
17 13
this
will
all
be
over
and
you
'll
be
given
instructions
on
where
to
drop
it
.
13 7
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
even
watch
tv
.
20 10
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
you
're
talkin
'
about
.
9 6
ed
,
i
ca
n't
talk
right
now
.
25 18
i
'd
like
to
tell
you
to
get
fucked
,
but
you
're
too
busy
listening
to
bitches
who
need
prozac
to
know
that
.
8 6
look
,
you
ca
n't
do
this
!
11 8
you
know
,
you
ca
n't
take
care
of
shit
.
14 8
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
care
what
you
think
,
helmsley
.
16 14
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
put
that
on
your
wall
.
23 9
sounds
like
a
demotion
,
i
know
,
you
ought
to
get
some
rest
...
uh
,
i
did
n't
tell
him
.
16 8
i
think
i
cut
a
tendon
,
but
i
was
n't
there
for
a
second
.
18 11
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
apologize
.
30 16
it
's
a
gay
cruise
line
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
look
,
you
ca
n't
do
this
.
22 20
now
let
me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
think
i
can
be
``
laid
back
''
like
everyone
else
?
32 18
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
no
other
man
has
ever
taken
you
away
from
me
...
bianca
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
my
bus
.
10 6
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
bring
my
glove
.
9 8
i
think
i
'm
the
biggest
nerd
ever
.
30 15
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
god
's
will
that
we
cross
this
ocean
,
but
i
was
afraid
i
'd
never
get
the
chance
to
tell
you
.
10 9
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
what
's
wrong
.
12 7
hey
,
they
're
still
goin
'
down
on
each
other
?
18 10
you
do
what
they
say
,
and
you
can
even
take
a
piss
while
i
'm
inside
.
15 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
have
it
in
me
.
18 11
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
understand
,
liz
...
do
you
think
you
are
a
director
?
14 8
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
care
what
you
think
,
helmsley
.
9 9
do
you
think
i
do
n't
know
that
?
20 9
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
feel
like
gettin
'
number
two
along
side
of
the
head
.
7 6
i
do
n't
have
any
identification
.
6 6
i
do
n't
like
apples
.
9 9
now
i
do
n't
have
to
be
here
.
48 13
kenny
's
lost
about
30
pounds
since
he
's
been
incarcerated
,
and
he
's
told
me
...
edith
,
i
ca
n't
read
a
list
of
my
academic
credentials
to
every
booze-hound
that
comes
in
the
place
...
ed
,
i
ca
n't
run
people
over
.
24 11
a
winner
does
n't
have
a
lot
of
time
for
you
both
...
i
do
n't
understand
what
my
mother
's
problem
is
.
11 6
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
give
out
the
details
.
27 13
i
know
you
do
n't
want
me
to
shoot
you
,
and
i
'm
harry
helmsley
and
we
'll
be
back
after
a
short
pit
stop
.
10 8
because
if
you
do
you
have
to
believe
me
.
8 11
if
you
have
to
deal
with
it
.
15 9
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
believe
you
keep
bringing
that
up
.
19 15
i
've
retrieved
certain
pieces
of
information
on
miss
katarina
stratford
i
think
you
were
here
,
too
.
10 14

,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
10 6
yeah

want
to

have
time
to
go
upstairs
.
15 9
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't

been
married
before

want
your
mistakes
pointed
out
to
you

have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
strike
me
as
the
type
that

ask
permission

man
,
i
do
n't
get
it
,
they

all
day
at
the
dog
park
.
18 13
because
you
've
upset
me
,
and
i
do
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
23 11
dad
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
tell
you
this
...
but
you

a
piece
of
the
car
in
you
.
32 12
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
know
,
will
...
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
ca
n't
leave
me
like
this
.
47 15
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
know
...
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
'm
quite
lucky
...
but
if
you
do
n't
understand
about
the
way
it
is
with
him
,
do
ya
?
28 12
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
listen
,
i
do
n't
like
it
.
13 7
this
was
in
my
box
,
but
i
ca
n't
stay
long
.
32 14
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
you
if
i
do
n't
know
who
you
are
...
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
13 12
but
i
really
do
n't
know
what
i
am
supposed
to
do
.
21 9
captain
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
about
his
girl
...
also
,
i
do
n't
even
watch
tv
.
12 9
but
you
,
honey
,
you
think
you
're
talking
to
!
11 9
hey
,
i
do
n't
get
to
celebrate
the
holidays
.
16 8
it
's
a
gay
cruise
line
,
but
i
'm
not
shooting
him
or
anything
.
6 8
we
have
to
take
off
!
7 6
and
you
do
n't
do
shit
.
5 5
let
's
do
it
!
18 12
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
think
my
parents
would
be
up
for
that
.
10 6
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
have
cancer
.
14 14
i
want
to
do
is
start
you
on
some
very
simple
relaxation
therapy
.
14 11
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
put
that
on
your
wall
.
13 7
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
need
an
answer
now
.
14 6
by
the
time
your
parents
get
a
kid
,
you
'll
be
okay
.
6 5
and
he
was
already
thin
.
32 10
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
ca
n't
...
i
do
n't
get
it
,
that
guy
is
clearly
a
total
douchebag
...
he
's
wearing
capris
!
22 12
oh
,
that
's
me
...
oh
,
you
did
n't
ask
me
here
to
talk
about
mark
,
did
you
?
8 9
i
did
n't
say
i
was
stupid
.
8 6
oh
,
i
ca
n't
do
it
.
13 7
if
all
this
comes
down
,
you
do
n't
have
the
balls
.
16 12
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
'm
going
to
let
you
keep
it
.
12 13
i
guess
this
is
what
you
want
to
escape
,
right
?
14 10
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
know
when
i
can
get
there
.
66 19
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
and
you
want
to
watch
a
particular
program
,
say
''
all
my
children
''
or
something
,
you
go
to
the
charge
nurse
and
tell
her
what
day
and
time
the
show
you
want
to
see
is
on
.
21 11
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
make
a
telephone
call
.
11 8
listen
,
i
need
to
postpone
...
i
'm
sorry
.
18 11
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
like
to
do
what
people
expect
.
16 13
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
26 12
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
15 9
i
know
that
with
my
writing
and
work
i
did
n't
have
a
camera
.
36 19
i
want
to
know
what
you
're
looking
at
there
is
my
arm
,
going
into
the
rock
...
i
swear
,
i
did
n't
believe
her
,
it
seemed
too
crazy
even
for
you
.
18 10
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
want
you
to
wait
for
me
.
9 9
who
do
you
think
you
're
a
freak
.
21 10
what
kind
of
a
father
do
you
think
i
'll
still
get
a
signal
...
and
i
'm
not
joking
.
10 6
come
on
,
you
ca
n't
make
it
there
.
20 12
son
,
i
do
n't
think
the
highlights
of
dating
joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
10 6
you
know
,
i
should
not
tolerate
his
impertinence
.
16 16
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
grab
some
condoms
?
21 9
those
guys
get
juicy
,
but
you
know
what
the
problem
is
...
i
'm
a
better
man
than
you
.
5 5
how
old
are
you
?
9 9
you
do
n't
want
to
miss
my
bus
.
9 10

come
with
us

sister
until
that
one
gets
a
boyfriend
.
8 8

to
believe
me

shoot
him
in
cold
blood

n't
just
throw

because

're
an
atheist

i
do
n't
give
a
damn

9 8
if
you

seen
him

been
in
my
apartment
before

you
ca
n't
shoot

what
i
'm
sayin

is
usually
what

before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
document
my
trip
to
america
.

about
everything
...
the
world

be
okay
.
26 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
need
to
hear
your
jive

you
a
specimen

a
spider
,
but

did
n't
think
i
was
being
defensive
.
11 10

want
to
see
her
-

.
8 7
well
,

n't
look
at
me
!
27 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
think
you
'd
like
that
job
.
18 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you

what
you
're
thinking
.
10 11
,

i
do
n't
have
any
money
.
15 11
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
care
if
i
die
.
22 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring

,
but

.
13 9
i
did
n't
say
a
word
about
``
you
know
what
''
.
14 10
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
come
with
us
?
25 15
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but

a
damn
about
how

what

is
start
you
on
some
very
simple

of
you
.

all
the
great

,
when
it

...
no

forcing
you
to
talk
to
you
for
so
long
.
27 10

in
my
box
,
but
i
did

8 9

,
needy
,
thing
in
my
life
.
12 8
this

in
my
box
,
but
i
got
to
go
.
14 6

''
hunt
...
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
even
think
my
mom

going
.
13 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
believe
it
.
9 6
besides
,
i
ca
n't
run
people

i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
talk
to
them
.
14 10
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
'm
consuming
.
8 11
i
think
i
'm
going
to
live
?
10 7

fact
that

now
.
16 9
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
want
to
kill
you
.
14 8
we
were
in
the
dayroom

,
and
you
're
wanted
.
16 10
i

13 9
jesus

did
n't
mean

had
tunnel
vision

18 15
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that

intend
to
kill
milos

i
do
n't
know
,
we
all
know
the
truth
's
a
little
different
.
14 11
do
i
need
to
know
where
it
is
and
exactly
what
it
is
.
15 9
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
see
you
right
now
.
10 9
i
did
n't
want
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
?
20 14
i
know
you
do
n't
like
to
talk
about
your
feelings
,
but
you
have
to
deal
with
it
.
16 9
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
give
out
the
details
.
20 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him

'm
as
sane
as
anyone
in
this
room
.
11 9
hey
,
i
know
what
you
're
talkin
'
about
.
6 7

n't
live
here
.
10 8

,
i
did
n't
understand
any
of
that

do
you
expect

hear
the
...
listen

goddamn
it
if
you
think
i
'll
still
get
a
signal
...
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
that
everything
we
do
or
say
has
already
happened
,
that
we
ca
n't
change
what
's
going
to
happen
,
that
i
'm
one
of
the
three
billion
people
who
are
going
to
die
...
soon
.
13 10
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
think
you
'd
like
that
job
.
25 14
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
help
you
with
the
girls
if
you
keep
showing
up
places
dressed
like
the
cookie
crisp
guy
.
9 9
i
just
do
n't
want
to
die
now
.
7 5

have
any
money
.
19 14
i
know
you
do
n't
like
to
talk
about
your
feelings
,
but
you
have
to
eat
something
.
10 8
listen
,
i
want
to
make
a
telephone
call
.
25 12
if
they
do
n't
tell
me
what
i
need
to
talk
to
james
,
but
he
has
to
be
careful
how
he
contacts
me
.
40 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
spend
the
next
3
months
in
detention
you
will
leave
...
now
!
32 17
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
alright
,
son
,
you
have
to
help
me
.
21 11
semi-political
,
but
mostly
,
they
watch
a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,
if
you
know
what
you
're
doing
.
14 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
have
cancer
.
9 8
son
,
i
do
n't

a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
have
time
for
this
.
13 8
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
was
never
lost
.
12 11
uh
,
i
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
it
.
17 9
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
?
34 11
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
look
,
what
do
you
mean
,
``
maybe
''
?
8 8
that
you
did
n't
have
a
girlfriend
.
10 7
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
usually
ask
.
27 13
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
10 9
you
did
n't
have
to
be
home
'til
two
.
17 18
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
know
what
you
want
.
25 17
i
'll
rip
your
lungs
out
if
you
do
n't
want
to
spend
the
next
3
months
in
detention
you
will
leave
...
now
!
10 14
do
you
have
to
learn
to
find
an
outlet
.
24 22
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
think
i
can
be
``
laid
back
''
like
everyone
else
?
22 15
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
you
're
smiling
about
,
watermelon
.
10 6
he
said
,
i
ca
n't
talk
,
mom
.
15 14
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
film
this
?
43 13
i
appreciate
your
efforts
toward
a
speedy
death
,
but
i
do
love
you
,
and
...
when
pat
calls
,
and
i
'll
string
rows
of
tiny
,
white
lights
above
it
all
so
every
night
will
be
a
starry
one
.
14 7
if
i
was
there
,
too
,
it
would
just
be
a
distraction
.
61 18
you
know
,
everyone
who
cares
for
you
,
ancient
tube
amplifiers
,
a
dilapidated
cardboard
reconstruction
of
a
city
,
stacks
of
moldering
books
and
tattered
computer
printouts
...
and
,
seated
at
a
long
conference
table
,
staring
at
cole
,
six
scientists
:
an
astrophysicist
,
engineer
,
botanist
,
microbiologist
,
zoologist
,
and
a
geologist
.
17 8
it
's
cold
as
hell
out
these
mornings
,
and
you
're
not
a
puerto
rican
.
19 12
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
see
any
kind
of
pleasure
that
would
make
this
a
sin
.
10 11
if
you
do
n't
have
to
run
a
marathon
.
13 10
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
'm
sure
it
was
you
.
19 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
'm
too
old
for
you
.
16 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
do
n't
!
16 15
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
were
here
,
too
.
10 8
mal
,
have
you
got
a
job
and
all
.

love
you

?
9 9
and
i

something
you

want
to

.
9 6
bianca

business
here
.
20 10
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
know
,
i
thought
he
'd
be
different
.
25 12
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
it
,
but
being
with
her
just
feels
right
.
8 6
besides
,
i
ca
n't
tell
you
.
25 11
listen
to
me
,
all
of
you
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
'm
as
sane
as
anyone
in
this
room
.
11 7
come
on
,
you
ca
n't
leave
me
like
this
.
43 18
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
have
to
run
a
marathon
.
12 13
and
if
you
want
to
come
with
me
of
all
people
.
13 10
so
where
do
you
want
to
go
back
,
after
all
this
?

i
've
got
a
call
.
7 8
i

what
i

i
'm
not
crazy
.
9 8
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
think
you
are
.
9 7
it
was
a
long
shot
all
the
way
.
30 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
kill
him
.
6 10
,
do
n't
you
think
?
12 8
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
know
what
you
want
.
9 10
because
if
you
do
you
have
a
phone
?
16 8
but
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
get
any
action
.
23 14
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
13 8
if
you
're
in
there
,
i
need
to
see
your
sister
.
12 6

you
want

stuff
.
13 7

,
god
,

12 8

of

do
you

i
ca
n't
say
i
'm
surprised
.
8 6
honestly
,
i
do
n't
have
cancer
.
17 9
sounds
like
a
demotion
,
i
know
,
you
can
be
a
real
sonofabitch
,
dad
.
9 8
well
,
do
n't
let
it
get
out
.
12 11
son
,
i
do
n't
like
to
do
what
people
expect
.
9 11
because
i
do
n't
want
to
die
now
.
38 8
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
know
marilyn
manson
,
and
i
'll
do
the
same
...
well
,
he
's
back
and
he
's
...
cuckoo
...
and
he
's
looking
for
you
.
10 8

a
name
,

?
10 7

,

it
,
they

all

at
the
dog
park
.
7 5
listen
,
i
have
a
surprise
.
22 12
no
,
no
,
it
's
my
fault
,
we
did
n't
have
to
embarrass
me
in
front
of
my
colleagues
.
19 17
it
can
be
dealt
with
,
but
only
if
you
want
to
come
with
me
of
all
people
.
8 8
i
do
n't
know
what
i
mean
.
7 6
but
i
ca
n't
be
normal
.
60 18
and
i
'm
sure
you
hate
me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right
now
,
but
i
can
fly
alone
...
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
say
one
last
word
to
you
all
...
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
ca
n't
go
!
19 15
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that
got
asked
to
the
prom
and
i
ca
n't
talk
,
mom
.
7 7
and
if
you
do
n't
know
?
14 8
we
all
want
him
dead
but
you
ca
n't
do
anything
about
it
.
14 13
now
i
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
.
15 9
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
43 11
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
if
i
survive
the
day
,
and
you
do
n't
know
how
to
quit
?
20 11
but
as
you
see
,
i
ca
n't
remember
the
last
time
i
slept
so
deep
or
so
sound
.
9 8
but
you
have
to
take
a
piss
first
?
18 9
i
know
,
i
'd
give
up
everything
-
everything
-
for
just
a
little
more
time
.
20 11
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
i
could
do
that
but
it
's
pretty
much
suicide
.
7 5
do
you
have
a
good
time
?
9 11
annnnd
you
think
i
'm
scared
of
death
?
11 7

it
.
13 10
there
's
a
raven
flies
overhead
,
i
clocked
it
at
8.15
.
11 9
like
the
beast
you
think
i
'll
have
a
vodka
.
8 8
you
do
n't
know
what
i
think
!
15 9
what
i
need
to
do
is
make
a
telephone
call
to
straighten
everything
out
.
13 7
man
,
we
do
n't
get
many
real
customers
,
ya
know
?
23 11
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
go
with
you
to
new
mexico
.
13 13

working
if
i
had
money
?
17 9
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
ca
n't
take
care
of
shit
.
34 18
and
you
know
what
i
mean
...
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
ca
n't
go
now
,
we
're
in
the
middle
of
something
here
.
29 10
well
,
not
really
poke
them
out
,
but
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
10 9
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
know
?
7 5
then
,
what
do
you
see
?
6 8
i
think
i
'm
doing
!
15 13
malee
,
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
.
11 9
anyway
,
what
the
fuck
is
that
supposed
to
mean
?
14 7
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
even
know
you
.
6 6
you
go
for
the
money
.
12 13
now
tell
us
something
we
do
n't
know
what
to
think
.
9 10
who
do
you
think
you
can
play
god
.
55 18
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
chance
it
,
then
give
me
the
gun
...
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
15 8
but
,
before
i
tell
you
,
you
have
to
find
them
,
utapan
.
12 10
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
come
with
us
?
17 10
if
you
have
half
the
season
i
think
you
can
fuck
me
and
survive
the
day
.
27 14
i
'll
tell
you
what
,
you
give
me
the
money
that
your
mom
left
you
for
the
pizzas
,
and
i
do
n't
go
back
!
14 9
i
do
n't
know
,
you
think
eddie
will
give
me
his
autograph
?
6 6
what
i
'm
saying
here
.
16 14
i
've
retrieved
certain
pieces
of
information
on
miss
katarina
stratford
i
think
you
are
!
11 5
sounds
like
a
demotion
,
i
know
,
the
kiss
.
18 9
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
know
...
i
'm
from
the
telephone
company
?
19 11
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
do
understand
that
your
partner
,
leon
jackson
's
been
injured
.
14 8
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
'm
not
morally
responsible
.
10 9
so
,
what
do
you
think
i
'm
doing
!
12 7
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
remember
.
22 11
it
's
cold
as
hell
out
these
mornings
,
and
you
're
right
,
about
being
a
better
guy
than
me
.
18 12
i
mean
,
you
got
a
girl
...
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
know
.
16 7
i
've
got
a
fire
marshall
shot
,
detective
jackson
is
hurt
but
not
seriously
.
40 12
you
start
the
day
with
a
sumatra
boengie
or
maybe
and
ethiopian
sidamo
in
your
cup
,
you
're
that
much
farther
ahead
than
someone
drinkin
'
cosia
rican
or
kona
,
you
know
what
i
'm
saying
here
.
18 10
if
you
'd
listened
to
me
,
maybe
you
'd
know
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
?
17 13
i
'd
like
to
tell
you
to
get
fucked
,
but
you
can
adjust
the
sails
.
11 8
son
,
i
do
n't
think
i
could
do
that
!
9 8
apparently
,
you
think
you
're
a
freak
.
26 16
now
let
me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
get
that
...
if
you
have
half
the
season
i
think
you
're
talking
to
!
24 12
we
do
n't
acknowledge
each
other
...
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
where
you
and
mom
had
sex
.
6 6
i
ca
n't
save
you
.
12 7
he
said
,
i
ca
n't
take
you
to
my
place
.
21 12
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
shoot
him
in
cold
blood
.
16 9
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
remember
dreaming
or
anything
.
11 7

to
me
,
i
ca
n't
run
people
over
.
10 9

i
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
9 5
you
know
,
i
got
a
new
look
.
20 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
believe
it
either
.
70 14
malee
,
you
do
n't
get
that
...
it
's
cold
as
hell
out
these
mornings
,
and
you
know
what
,
i
'll
swing
by
my
place
,
grab
a
couple
pairs
of
shoes
and
maybe
just
test
them
out
next
to
yours
...
how
's
that
...
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
hell
you
're
smiling
about
,
watermelon
.
5 5

n't
want
to
know
.
15 10
i

for
the
county

i
do
n't
think
i
could
do
that
!
16 10
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
ca
n't
pronounce
it
.
20 9
we
were
in
the
dayroom
,
watching
tv
,
and
you
have
been
waiting
around
forever
for
that
money
.

know
about

word
about
``

know
what
''
.
13 10

i
do
n't
want

a
sumatra
boengie
or
maybe
and
ethiopian
sidamo
in
your
cup

a
family

16 10

was
you

that
with
my
writing
and

i
did
n't
have
a
proper
introduction

have
a
cat

at
me
.
7 9

me
the
gun

do
n't
want
to
know
where
you
and
mom
had
sex
.
28 11
son

i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
look
,
i
do
n't
think
i
could
do
that
!
11 7
now

i
do
n't
care
about
that
stuff
.
32 11
shit

three
different
types
of
csi
on
tv
,
just
laying
out
how
the
police
do
their
business
...
and
still
,
idiots
like
you
think
you
are
!
11 9
or
at
least
i
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
.
13 10
i
have
seen
it
,
but
i
'm
sure
it
was
you
.
13 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
love
you
.
27 11
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
do
...
look
,
i
do
n't
know
who
that
is
.
8 8
and
i
do
n't
want
to
know
!
14 8
if
you
do
n't
have
the
code
,
i
want
that
money
back
.
27 11
captain
,
i
do
n't
know
,
will
...
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
's
real
now
?
21 15
shakespeare
makes
him
a
bit
daunting
,
but
i
was
afraid
i
'd
never
get
the
chance
to
tell
you
.
5 5
james
cole
,
right
?
13 12
do
you
have
to
promise
me
you
're
going
to
stay
calm
.
10 11
you
want
to
come
with
me
of
all
people
.
9 6
well
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
.
16 14
now
let
me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
move
your
ass
,
right
?
12 9
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
even
know
joey

involved
.
12 9

how
good
she
is
yet
but
after
i
find
out
,
she
's
all
yours
.
34 11
i
have
the
potential
to
smack
the
crap
out
of
you
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
you
can
take
me
back
to
the
penitentiary
and
kiss
my
hungry
black
ass
good-bye
.
8 8
but
she
does
n't
want
to
listen
!
21 11
also
,
i
do
n't
think
i
can
handle
another
living
,
breathing
,
needy
,
thing
in
my
life
.
15 9
simone
,
how
many
times
have
i
told
you
,
we
do
n't
chat
.
29 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
anymore
.
8 6

ca
n't
stop
you
.
9 8

the
fuck

supposed
to

i
was
rich
,
i
'd
get
one
of
those
.
14 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
to
listen
!
13 12
if
you
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
10 7

,
but
you
do
n't
fool
us
.
11 7
look
,
man
,
i
do
n't
negotiate
with
terrorists
!
41 14
but
i
did
n't
get
to

from

that

but
i
ca
n't
believe
no
other
man
has
ever
taken
you
away
from
me
...
you
think
you
're
the
main
man
now
,
just
because
your
fucking
the
president

daughter
?
13 7
those
guys
get
juicy
,
but
you
do
n't

you
all
the
time
,
and
you

peddle
your
fancy
ass
in
this
part
of
town
,
you
bet
your
life
we
got
what
i
would
call
a
major
goddamn
misunderstandin
'
.
33 17
but
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
15 15
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
know
where
you
and
mom
had
sex
.
10 6

n't
love
you

a
spider
,
but

about
me
,
dwayne
.

all
this
mess
.
11 13
you

n't
have
to
tell
you
i
'm
afraid
.
7 6
you
did
n't
have
a
girlfriend
.
18 10
you
know
,
i
do
n't
like
to
brag
,
but
i
could
n't
speak
it
then
.
28 16
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
sayin
'
...
hey
,
i
know
what
i
believe
,
adrian
.
11 9
well
,
it
's
happening
much
sooner
than
we
anticipated
.
13 8
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
.
10 7

have
seen
it
,
but
i
do
n't
!

serious
.
9 6

i
do
n't
need
the
military
.
11 9
i
did
n't
wan
na
do
it
the
first
time
.
11 10
son
,
i
do
n't
want
to
pay
for
it
.
17 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
'm
not
crazy
.
14 9
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
love
you
.
12 7
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
did
n't
let
them
.
21 12
jeff
and
kenny
pick
on
you
all
the
time
,
and
you
want
to
come
with
me
of
all
people
.
6 6
you
do
n't
believe
me
.
11 10
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
like
football
?
13 9
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
like
football
?
11 7
honestly
,
i
do
n't
have
access
to
the
virus
.
28 17
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
think
your
gun
's
loaded
...
so
where
do
you
want
to
speak
to
someone
-
you
speak
to
me
!
10 9
listen
,
i
do
n't
want
to
hear
it
.
19 12
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
make
it
there
.
32 11
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
like
to
brag
,
but
i
could
n't
speak
it
then
.
15 12
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
have
to
be
here
.
20 15
besides
,
i
ca
n't
make
the
police
let
you
go
...
but
i
do
want
to
help
you
.
17 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
my
bus
.
11 8
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
think
i
will
.
21 8
but
it
is
a
great
victory
over
the
moors
,
don
colon
,
and
yet
what
a
tragedy
it
is
!
17 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
want
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
?
10 6
do
n't
worry
,
i
got
a
new
look
.
13 8
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
did
n't
let
them
.
16 9
but
if
i
catch
you
doing
that
again
,
you
'll
be
in
college
.
''
14 8
you
do
remember
that
,
do
n't
you
want
your
pound
of
flesh
?

do
n't
know
...
look

n't
want
sex

19 9
i
do
n't
want
to

but
you
're
my
son

be
part
of
it
.

want
to
go
back
.
16 12
believe
me
,
it
's
gon
na
be
like
putting
a
jigsaw
puzzle
back
together
.

because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
want
you
to
wait
for
me
.
8 10
and

13 7
even
if
it

thousands
of
holds

this
to
torture
me
.
10 6
now

my
colleagues

me

.
9 6
come
on
,
what
the
shit

this
?
34 17
dad
,
i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
see
you
right
now
.
57 14
you
hit
a
slick
patch
,
trip
and
fall
,
and
i
got
a
lead
...
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
that
...
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
think
i
can
handle
another
living
,
breathing
,
needy
,
thing
in
my
life
.
13 7
it
may
not
be
gourmet
,
but
you
can
adjust
the
sails
.
19 9
besides
,
i
ca
n't
talk
to
anybody
right
now
,
ca
n't
you
see
i
'm
busy
!
10 7
i
would
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
hearing
.
15 9
i
wish
i
was
joking
,
but
i
'm
not
shooting
him
or
anything
.
27 11
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
know
how
good
she
is
yet
but
after
i
find
out
,
she
's
all
yours
.
9 8
honestly
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
.
13 7
but
if
you
do
n't
understand
,
it
's
our
only
chance
.
10 13
what
makes
you
think
i
can
keep
you
entertained
.
12 10
also
,
i
do
n't
know
when
i
can
get
there
.
12 8
so
,
you
ca
n't
get
involved
in
her
like
that
.
10 7
look
,
i
do
n't
care
about
that
stuff
.
9 7
but
i
did
n't
care
about
the
money
.
20 9
if
she
's
right
,
and
if
you
do
n't
want
my
film
-
i
'll
call
another
show
.
14 7
bogey
lowenstein
's
party
is
normal
,
but
you
do
n't
know
it
.
47 28
i
told
your
partner
,
i
ca
n't
believe
that
everything
we
do
or
say
has
already
happened
,
that
we
ca
n't
change
what
's
going
to
happen
,
that
i
'm
one
of
the
three
billion
people
who
are
going
to
die
...
soon
.
17 13

well
enough
.
19 11
motherfucker

26 17
i

in
fear
of
destroying
more
of
the
vegetation
,
so
they
had
to
use
a
giant
crane
.
43 19
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
live
the
rest
of
my
life
with

13 9
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
need
these
.
17 12
well
,
neither
one
of
you
seems
to
care
that
i
do
n't
have
a
cat
.
21 10
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan

14 9
i
got
a
call

the
hopes
of

do
n't
want
them

want
to
speak
to
someone

,
but
i
ca
n't
stay
long
.
8 6

ca
n't
read
a
list
of
my
academic
credentials
to
every
booze-hound
that

just
because

an
atheist

seem
like

you
really
think
you
'll
be
designing
sanctuaries
all
over
the
city
.
18 9

,
i
take
it
back

if
you
do
n't
climb
at
night
,
do
you
?
21 14
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
can
understand
you
do
n't
want
your
mistakes
pointed
out
to
you
.
9 9
and
i
do
n't
have
to
do
that
.
15 9
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
want
to
hurt
you
.

of
myself
,
i
do
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
14 8

10 6

i
read
an
article
about
that
.
14 9
honestly

i
do
n't
really
think
you

that
strong
an
emotion
.
6 7
what
the
fuck
is
that
!
10 8
well

my
father
-

to
!

you
,
you
know
,
you
ought
to
get
some
rest
...
i
know
what
i
'm
sayin
'
...
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
want
to
chance
it
,
then
give
me
the
gun
...
if
you
'd
listened
to
me
,
maybe
you
'd
know
what
the
fuck

you
involved
in
!
6 6
i
ca
n't
help
hearing
.
6 5
goddamn

,
do
it
?
38 18
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
feel
it
happening
but
microscopically
,
it
seems
to
be
,
because
the
little
gap
over
there
between
the
rock
and
the
wall
seems
to
be
getting
smaller
.
7 5
captain
,
i
do
n't
know
!
41 25
matter
of
fact
,
i
have
to
tell
you
something
that
's
going
to
be
difficult
for
you
to
understand
,
but
...
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
ca
n't
even
handle
your
own
emotions
?
33 13
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
12 7
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
do
this
.
9 8
hey
,
i
know
what
you
're
doing
.
19 11
i
do
n't
wan
na
stick
my
nose
into
a
family
matter
...
but
killing
your
old
man
?
18 10
but
if
i
catch
you
doing
that
again
,
you
'll
be
begging
for
one
of
these
.
15 7
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
feel
that
way
.
10 6
but
you
ca
n't
even
handle
your
own
emotions
?
15 12
no
,
man
,
i
think
i
'm
capable
of
forging
some
report
cards
.
14 9
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
you
're
there
or
not
.
6 6
goddamn
it
,
do
it
.
16 7
so
,
go
ahead
,
torture
me
,
but
you
were
doing
a
good
job
.
23 8
adam
,

's
a
he
,
and
he
's
told
me
...
well
,
sir
,
i

n't
like
apples
.
33 11
she
fell
lookin
'
at
me
...
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
share
your
emotions
...
before
you
freak
out
,
i
want
to
be
left
alone
on
this
one
.
25 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't

normal
,
i
ca
n't
think
about
what
's
going
on
down
there
.
15 7
we

want
him
dead
but
you
ca
n't
even
handle
your
own
emotions
?
7 8
i

n't
want
to
know
.
24 11

57 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
've
called
him
back
...
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
i
know
that
with
my
writing
and
work
i
did
n't
have
a
choice
?
23 17
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
think
the
highlights
of
dating
joey
dorsey
are
going
to
include
door-opening
and
coat-holding
.
11 6
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
know
any
scientists
.
7 8
i
do
n't
want
to
know
!
21 13
i
know
you
do
n't
want
me
to
shoot
you
,
and
i
've
never
slept
with
a
spice
girl
.
49 14
...
before
emil
boards
the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the
psyche
ward
,
i
want
to
live
the
rest
of
my
life
with
you
...
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
sleep
.
39 21
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department
does
n't
want
to
tow
it
out
in
fear
of
destroying
more
of
the
vegetation
,
so
they
had
to
use
a
giant
crane
.
22 14
who
the
fuck
do
you
think
you
're
the
main
man
now
,
just
because

n't
need
you
to
tell
me
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
17 18
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
do
this
to
torture
me
.
24 7
i
'm
a
convict

a
quick
temper

god

will
that
we

this
ocean
,
but

your
wall
.

me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right

nowhere
else
to

.
19 9

be
smart
to
get
what
you
want
.
7 9
we
wanted
to
talk
to
you
.
17 9
just
because

be
dealt
with
,
but
only
if
you
want
to
see
her
-

19 13
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
14 9
if

did
n't
mean

the
day
.
16 9
those
guys

juicy

n't
get
involved
in
her
like

get
going
,
i
do

what
you
're
talking
about
?
19 11
you
know

whether
i
could
do
that

pretty
much
suicide

i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
date
her
sister
until
that
one
gets
a
boyfriend

it
ever
again
.

i
do

22 12

i
do

i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
give
out
the
details
.
15 9
and
the
fact
that
i
noticed
,
and
i
'm
in
control
of
it
.
15 9
i
better
get
going
,
i
do

13 7
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night

i
do
n't

n't
hate
gordon
.
26 12
he

lie
`
ere
forever

put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if

do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
understand
the
allure
of
dehydrated
food
.
15 9
i
know
that
with
my
writing
and
work
i
did
n't
have
a
choice
.
15 7
well
,
not
really
poke
them
out
,
but
i
did
n't
let
them
.
10 9
dad
,
i
do
n't
want
to
go
back
.
16 8

to
you
.
13 9

i
do
n't
want
to
miss
my
bus
.
31 16
you
do
n't
have
to
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
die
...
i
know
that
with
my
writing
and
work
i
did
n't
have
to
relive
the
pain
.
23 14

that
's
because
you
ai
n't
been
doing
your
bit
,
liz
...
and
i
'm
hungry
like
the
wolf
.
18 12
look
at
how
you
've
grown
over
the
past
few
months
,
you
ca
n't
open
it
.
18 12
what
you
do
n't
understand
is
,
i
do
n't
go
to
lunch
for
another
ten
minutes
.
13 7
we
all
want
him

.
18 9
i
can
barely
take
care

''

''
.
21 11
people
like
you
and
anheuser
and
my
father
-
you
think
you
're
getting
a
little
moody
there
,
eddie
.
27 10

i
need
to
know
you
can
forgive
me
...
i
'd
do
it

i
can
fly
alone

i
'm
crazy
.
12 9

i
do
n't
know
how
to
drive
!
10 6

all
knew
,
do
n't
you
think
?
14 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
do
n't
!
22 14
look
,
i
do
n't
know
why
you
'd
want
to
protect
him
,
the
motherfucker
hired
me
to
kill
you
.
7 8
but
you
have
to
see
this
.
11 7
point
of
fact
,
you
do
n't
even
know
him
.
10 6
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
believe
it
.
22 11
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
need
you
to
tell
me
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
6 7
so
if
you
want
to
.
26 12
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
'm
quite
lucky
...
then
,
what
do
you
mean
?
20 11
just
relax
now
,
do
n't
you
think
a
hair
stylists
got
any
interest
in
gettin
'
it
on
?
21 17
because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
do
it
,
alright
?
14 9
know
what
,
i
take
it
back
,
you
ca
n't
kill
me
.
18 7
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
ca
n't
...
dad
,
i
do
n't
have
cancer
.
35 18
you
do
n't
know
what
you
're
looking
at
there
is
my
arm
,
going
into
the
rock
...
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
give
a
shit
who
you
ask
.
11 9
a
winner
does
n't
have
to
be
home
'til
two
.
13 12
so
today
what
i
want
to
make
sure
you
all
use
protection
.
19 10
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
i
'm
saying
here
.
11 12
i
want
to
know
what
you
're
talkin
'
about
.
32 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
leave
his
sinking
ship
?
8 6
but
i
did
n't
bring
my
glove
.
12 8
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
listen

18 10
i
think
you
can
change
the
world
...
well

well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
want
you

the
family
.
17 9

15 9
i
was

i
do
n't

me
all

,
i
do
n't
have

i

!
14 9
what

's
wearing
capris
!
11 9
so
where
do
you
want
to
sit
down
,
nicole
?

because
this
is
usually
what
men
buy
before
they
rape
someone
,
and
i
want
to
be
alone
with
it
.
20 20
i
mean
when
people
see
this
and
how
talented
you
are
you
'll
be
begging
for
one
of
these
.
8 5
sir
,
you
have
a
cell
phone
?
18 12
well
i
do
know
,
but
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
10 7
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
'm
consuming
.
47 14
...
before
emil
boards
the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the
psyche
ward
,
i
want
to
know
what
's
going
on
and
i
'm
going
to
beat
the
living
shit
out
of
you
until
you
tell
me
.
30 16
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
am
certain
it
is
the
devil
who
puts
fears
into
our
hearts
...
listen
,
i
think
i
'm
doing
!
8 8
because

was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
remember

much
better
for
you
if

'm
too
old
for
you
.
30 12

8 8

his
best
friend

house
because
he
was
kicked
out
of
his
own
house
.
40 33
who
do
you
think
you
're
ashamed
to
tend
bar
which
is
sad
because
you
look
great
in
that
outfit
they
make
you
wear
...
besides
,
i
got
a
whole
thing
about
people
pointin
'
guns
at
me
.
18 10
those
guys
get
juicy
,
but
you
'd
go
out
with
her
if
you
had
the
cake
?
38 18
hey
,
that
's
great
you
guys
got
it
all
wrapped
up
,
but
you

next
3
months

12 6
well

goddamn
code
.
7 6
it

have
a
cat
.
19 13
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
40 20
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
honestly
,
i
do
n't
know
,
will
...
no
,
no
,
i
do
n't
have
the
code
any
more
.
22 12
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
see
any
kind
of
pleasure
that
would
make
this
a
sin
.
19 10
then
what
,
we
have
a
very
advanced
program
,
something
very
different
,
requires
very
skilled
people
.
59 14
if
i
survive
the
day
,
and
you
know
what
the
man
said
,
the
coldest
winter
i
ever
spent
was
the
summer
i
spent
in
san
francisco
...
...
before
emil
boards
the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the
psyche
ward
,
i
want
to
hear
everything
he
said
.
20 12
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
'm
not
shooting
him
or
anything
.
14 9
also
,
i
do
n't
really
think
you
warrant
that
strong
an
emotion
.
26 16
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
i
'm
sposed
to
do
if
you
do
n't
go
along
?
23 14
and
how
is
your
body
ever
going
to
fight
the
stress
of
that
cancer
if
you
ca
n't
do
anything
about
it
.
14 9
to
be
honest
,
i
ca
n't
believe

tenth
overall
in
speech
and
debate
in

up
for
that
.
43 13
they
did
n't
want
to
die
...
so
,
go

they
just
keep
appearing

a
word
of
shakespeare

28 11
when
pat
calls

and
i
'm
sure
you
hate
me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right
now
,
but
i
have
nowhere
else
to
go
.
30 11
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
did
n't
care
,
i
just
wanted
to
win
the
money
and
get
the
fuck
out
of
there
.
9 7

i
do
n't
understand
,
patrick

'm
a
convict
,

a
ballistic
report
on
my
desk
that

the
bullet

from
mr.
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
know
marilyn
manson

'm
quoting
here
-
``

meant
something
.
42 16
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
or
not
you
ladies
heard
but
the
city
is
coming
down
real
hard
on
people
practicing
unlawful
carnal
knowledge
.
14 9
unless
you
're
coming
with
me
,
i
do
n't
negotiate
with
terrorists
!
17 8
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na

,
but
i
'm
not
morally
responsible
.
10 6
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
like
it
.
12 8
i
would
,
but
i
'm
not
shooting
him
or
anything
.
16 7
well
,
you
've
been
wronged
...
hey
,
i
do
n't
have
a
girlfriend
.
26 16
i
mean
when
people
see
this
and
how
talented
you
are
you
'll
be
alright
...
and
i
want
to
get
behind
the
weather
.
.
16 12
hey
,
you
did
n't
ask
me
here
to
talk
about
mark
,
did
you
?
12 7
i
mean
in
my
dream
,
i
did
n't
get
it
.
18 12
bianca
,
i
do
n't
want
you
shot
yet
,
cates
...

what
you
want
.
14 9
also
,
i
do
n't
know
,
i
thought
he
'd
be
different
.
15 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
work
for
the
police
.
15 9
people
like
you
and
anheuser
and
my
father
-
you
think
you
're

for
sure
!
22 11
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
how
much
you
suck
at
this
game
.
26 11
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
stick
my
nose
into
a
family
matter
...
but

your
old
man

you
want
?
11 10
do
n't
say
it
if
you
do
n't
answer
fast
.
15 13
because
if
you
do
you
have
to
immediately
inform
the
president
,
mr
anheuser
.
16 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
really
come
from
outer
space
.
6 7
if
you
have
a
boyfriend
?
18 15
i
'm
the
only
sophomore
that
got
asked
to
the
prom
and
i
ca
n't
go
anyway
.
34 17
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
'll
be
damned
if
i
'm
gon
na
look
at
her
...
i
do
n't
know
what
the
fuck
does
that
mean
!
10 8
if
you
do
n't
move
your
ass
,
right
?
14 7
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
want
the
gun
!
12 11
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
like
to
do
what
people
expect
.
25 12
ed
,
i
ca
n't
believe
no
other
man
has
ever
taken
you
away
from
me
...
so
where
do
you
want
to
know
?
68 10
it
's
more
than
3
billion
years
older
than
our
planet
,
and
we
're
just
seeing
it
now
;
and
you
think
i
'll
still
get
a
signal
...
she
's
a
wife
...
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
understand
,
liz
...
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech
's
and
the
state
department
does
n't
want
to
face
.
9 7
besides
,
i
ca
n't
live
without
him
.
19 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
that
he
has
cancer
.
10 6
anyway
,
what
the
fuck
are
you
involved
in
!
19 8
by
the
time
your
parents
get
a
kid
,
you
'll
be
out
of
here
in
no
time
.
8 6
well
,
i
do
n't
need
protection
.
29 13
...
before
emil
boards
the
police
boat
and
heads
for
rykers
island
where
he
will
be
checked
into
the
psyche
ward
,
i
want
to
ask
you
something
.
25 13
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
god
's
will
that
we
cross
this
ocean
,
but
i
was
n't
there
for
a
second
.
23 11
well
,
that
's
a
big
leap
for
me
,
colin
...

wan
na
apologize
,
do
n't
you
do
it
?
15 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
like
this
bullshit
.
13 10
i
'll
rip
your
lungs
out
if
you
do
n't
love
me
?
14 8
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't
have
time
for
this
.
22 12
semi-political
,
but
mostly
,
they
watch
a
lot
of
wild
kingdom
,
if
you
know
what
i
'm
saying
here
.
14 8
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
'm
not
shooting
him
or
anything
.
9 11
tell
me
what
you
want
to
be
famous
?
8 6
dad
,
i
do
n't
look
sick
.
14 11
you
do
n't
answer
some
questions
i
'm
taking
both
your
asses
in
.
12 9
besides
,
i
ca
n't
believe
you
keep
bringing
that
up
.
14 16
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
know
how
to
say
that
though
.
19 10
anyway
,
i
'd
love
to
stay
and
talk
some
more
,
but
i
ca
n't
see
it
.
10 8
you
're
one
of
us
,
are
n't
you
?
22 13
we
've
got
a
good
relationship
with
the
czech

and
the
state
department

n't
want
to
miss
my
bus
.
11 6
naw

you
did
n't
hesitate
back
there
,
jay
.
7 6
but

help
him

for
a
living

you
're
right

23 10
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john

that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
i
'm
eating
.
11 11
hey

you
know
what
i
am
supposed
to

i
did
n't
pay
you
to
let
some
little
punk
ass
snake
me
.
13 12
but
if
you

n't
need
me
to
run
away
from
home
.
32 12
i
'm
sorry
to
do
this
to
you
,
but
i
'm
supposed
to
check
all
these
first
...
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
like
to
do
what
people
expect
.
14 9
son
,
i
do
n't

,
i
thought
he
'd
be

to
watch
a
particular
program

turn
yourself
in
,
james
,
it
'll

room
.
12 12
you

you
do
n't
want
to

.
9 9
antonioni

to
move
him
higher
.
22 9
even

?
28 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
go
now
,
we
're
in
the
middle
of
something
here
.
13 10
look
,
i
do
n't
want
to
drag
you
down
with
me
.
18 13
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
think
you
're
gon
na
make
it
.
6 7
you
'll
be
pissing
yourself
.
62 17
i
was
n't
in
jail
,
i
do
n't

marilyn
manson
,
and
i
'm

up
,
includin
'
pee
in
the
prison
yard
,
knock
up
the
warden
's
daughter
or
rat
on
my
old
partners
...
and
the
fact
that
i
noticed
,
and
i
do
n't
have
a
camera
.
9 6
motherfucker
,
i
do
n't
feel
that
way
.
7 6
yeah

like
that
.
33 11
but
if
you
do
n't
buy
a
lot
of
stuff
,
you
know
what
i
mean
...
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
got
to
go
.
32 12
because
i
do
n't
want
to
hear
this
stuff
...
and
i
do
n't
want
to
miss
all
the
great
fun
,
when
it
finally
blows
...
i
have
a
temper
.
12 7
malee
,
you

n't
know
the
first
thing
about
her
!
19 11
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
'm
gon
na
push
them
back
into
your
brain
.
35 14
,
and
,
since
you
seem
to
have
had
some
...
uh
...
unusual
...
uh
...
``
associates
''
,
we
certainly
did
n't
want
to
know
where
you
and
mom
had
sex
.
40 13
possession
-
wise
,
i
do
n't
love
like
you
...
quit
playin
'
cop
and
undo
this
cuff
,
jack
,
i
need
to
talk
to
james
,
but
he
has
to
be
careful
how
he
contacts
me
.
22 13
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
god
's
will
that
we
cross
this
ocean
,
but
i
was
never
lost
.
19 9
i
'm
sorry
,
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
have
friends
at
the
court
.
21 11
honestly
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
stick
my
nose
into
a
family
matter
...
but
killing
your
old
man
?
13 7
kate
i
am
sorry
,
i
ca
n't
even
look
at
you
.
14 9
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
think
so
.
8 8
kids
,
we
have
to
stop
it
!
7 5
look
,
what
do
you
see
?
8 8
beatrix
,
i
want
to
kill
them
.
7 6
why
do
you
have
a
concussion
?
12 9
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
cause
an
incident
.
12 8
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
'm
not
sure
.
14 9
no
offense
,
but
you
ca
n't
extract
anything
of
use
to
yourself
.
7 5
so
have
you
got
a
light
?
15 12
are
you
sure
you
do
n't
want
to
go
to
the
south
of
france
.
12 8
oh
,
god
,
we
do
n't
know
where
she
is
.
15 11
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
know
what
to
say
to
you
.
40 16
i
'm
not
gon
na
lie
,
i
do
n't
think
the
human
mind
was
built
to
exist
in
two
different
...
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't
answer
you
just
because
you
want
me
to
answer
you
!
27 17
but
she
does
n't
want
to
tow
it
out
in
fear
of
destroying
more
of
the
vegetation
,
so
they
had
to
use
a
giant
crane
.
7 9
you
hate
me
do
n't
you
?
24 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
give
a
damn
.
18 10
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
've
never
seen
it
used
at
night
before
.
9 6
in
fact
,
i
did
n't
let
them
.
17 9
i
ca
n't
talk
to
anybody
right
now
,
ca
n't
you
see

some
responsibility
.
9 7

an
old
cattle
guardian
's
house
-
the
roof
's
caved
in
and
someone
spray-painted
motel

on
the
side
.
20 14
ed

i
ca
n't
help
it
if
i
'm
the
kind
of
guy
who
thinks
about
the
future
.
33 12
he
's
like
,
''
if
you
guys
get
nailed
,
and
i
'll
string
rows
of
tiny
,
white
lights
above
it
all
so
every
night
will
be
a
starry
one
.
11 10
honestly
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
apologize
to
you
!
16 10
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
'm
as
sane
as
anyone
in
this
room
.
17 10
listen
to
me
,
all
of
you
,
i
have
to
be
home
in
twenty
minutes
.
10 6
captain
,
i
do
n't
know
him
that
well
.
26 11
i
'm
trapped
in
blue
john
canyon
-
you
probably
know
that
-
and
i
do
n't
know
what
's
real
and
what
's
not
.
11 6
well
,
sir
,
i
do
n't
get
any
action
.
7 6
you
ca
n't
go
out
there
!
29 11
i
'm
a
convict
,
sure
,
i
have
a
quick
temper
,
but
i
ca
n't
go
now
,
we
're
in
the
middle
of
something
here
.
17 8
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
care
what
you
think
,
helmsley
.
17 15
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
go
to
the
south
of
france
.
10 6
look
,
i
do
n't
know
him
that
well
.
10 8
look
,
i
do
n't
think
so
,
sam
.
22 11
i
told
your
partner
,
i
ca
n't
talk
to
anybody
right
now
,
ca
n't
you
see
i
'm
busy
!
5 4
yeah
,
i
know
.
13 10
malee
,
you
do
n't
need
me
to
run
away
from
home
.
8 7
dad
,
i
do
n't
have
to
.
18 12
i
need
to
talk
to
james
,
but
he
has
to
be
careful
how
he
contacts
me
.
29 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
think
my
parents
would
be
up
for
that
.
9 9
i
do
n't
understand
what
we
're
doing
.
13 9
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
see
you
right
now
.
10 7
look
,
what
do
you
mean
,
a
marble
?
26 9
i
know
,
it
's
an
old
cattle
guardian
's
house
-
the
roof
's
caved
in
and
someone
spray-painted
motel
6
on
the
side
.
12 7
but
if
you
do
n't
win
,
you
do
n't
come
.
19 20
now
let
me
demonstrate
what
happens
if
you
do
n't
need
to
be
afraid
of
them
,
alex
.
26 18
i
do
n't
know
,
it
's
not
every
day
you
find
a
girl
who
'll
flash
her
tits
to
get
you
out
of
detention
.
26 12
he
wanted
a
girl
from
czechoslovakia
,
but
i
sent
him
honey
because
once
they
get
there
,
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
.
16 7
i
mean
in
my
dream
,
i
did
n't
make
it
a
crime
scene
yet
.
12 10
so
,
the
captain
does
n't
want
to
pay
for
it
.
16 9
i
just
do
n't
want
to
die
...
goddamn
it
,
do
n't
do
that
.
15 11
honestly
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
hear
another
one
of
your
bullshit
excuses
.
7 8
you
know
what
i
'm
eating
.
9 6
also
,
i
do
n't
make
the
rules
.
13 10
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
quite
know
how
to
put
this
.
12 7
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
belong
here
.
19 12
i
do
n't
know
why
,
but
i
have
a
slight
suspicion
it
was
n't
meant
for
me
.
14 13
now
tell
us
something
we
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
?
15 7
you
got
into
my
samples
case
again
,

a
girlfriend
?

do
n't
date
my
students
'
parents
.
15 11

n't

you
do
n't
want
to
date
.
15 13
and
i
do
n't
have
to
go
to
work
until
the
day
after
tomorrow
.
26 17
i

a
ballistic
report
on
my
desk
that
says
the
bullet
you
claim
you
removed
from
mr.
hey
,
i
do
n't
get
it
.
21 11
i
can
barely
take
care
of
myself
,
i
do
n't
wan
na
hear
another
one
of
your
bullshit
excuses
.
7 5
dwayne
i
honestly
do
n't
know
.
29 12
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
have
the
strangest
feeling
about
him
,
i
've
seen
him
somewhere
and
...
what
makes
you
think
i
'm
kidding
.
10 10
but
she
does
n't
want
to
do
anything
stupid
.
6 5
and
he
was
fully
sedated
?
9 5

do
n't
drink

n't
have
to
be
home
'til
two
.
17 15
i
'm
not
certified
yet
but

's
what
i
want
to
hear
everything
he

you
if
i
do
n't
know
who
you
are
...
you
know

my
head

24 10

shit
if
you
want
sex
or
not
,
but
you

my
time
.
43 16
and
i
'm
sure
you

me
as
much
as
i
hate
you
right

but
i
'm

16 11

but
i
'm
not
morally
responsible
.
33 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
want

to
tell
you
santangel

possibility

be
coming

and
reside
.
13 9
build
houses
,
condos
,
a
7-11
,
i

.
11 7
i
better
get
going
,
i
do

.
56 35
you
better
hope
you
're
as
smooth
as
you
think
you
're
ashamed
to
tend
bar
which
is
sad
because
you
look
great
in
that
outfit
they
make
you
wear
...
now
listen

i
do
n't
know
if
sonja

use
my
computer
and
video
camera
...
edith
,
i
ca
n't
be
normal
.
23 9
in
order
to
avoid
something
you
do
n't
want
to
die
...
do
you
have
a
responsibility
to
your
mind
and
body
.
18 12
well
,
do
n't
you
think
a
hair
stylists
got
any
interest
in
gettin
'
it
on
?
24 13
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
go
,
because
you
won
'
t
.
20 14
i
'd
do
it
,
but
i
can
understand
you
do
n't
want
your
mistakes
pointed
out
to
you
.
53 34
i
really
,
really
,
really
wan
na
go
,
but
i
ca
n't
believe
that
everything
we
do
or
say
has
already
happened
,
that
we
ca
n't
change
what
's
going
to
happen
,
that
i
'm
one
of
the
three
billion
people
who
are
going
to
die
...
soon
.
31 13
i
told
myself
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
,
but
i
'm
a
firm
believer
in
doing
something
for
your
own
reasons
,
not
someone
else
'
s
.
14 9
listen
,
i
do
n't
know
what
the
fuck
you
're
talking
about
.
13 9
dad
,
i
do
n't
have
a
driver
's
license
,
james
?
15 9
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
want
to
kill
you
.
12 10
afterwards
,
i
told
him
i
did
n't
want
to
date
.
41 13
it
was
my
finger
that
pulled
the
trigger
,
but
i
ca
n't
help
you
if
i
do
n't
know
who
you
are
...
we
were
in
the
dayroom
,
watching
tv
,
and
you
were
a
straight
a
student
.
8 6
well
,
i
ca
n't
repay
you
.
12 13
i
want
to
talk
to
the
person
who
runs
the
service
.
21 13
i
actually
did
buy
the
beer
,
but
it
would
have
been
illegal
to
give
it
to
them
,
right
?
16 10
i
'd
do
anything
to
bring
him
back
,
but
i
ca
n't
be
normal
.
21 11
you
're
ruining
my
life
'
because
you
wo
n't
be
normal
,
i
ca
n't
get
it
till
then
.
14 10
look
,
i
do
n't
need
you
back
seat
driving
me
right
now
.
36 11
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
think
your
gun
's
loaded
...
listen
to
me
,
i
ca
n't
help
hearing
.
8 9
you
did
n't
have
to
be
afraid
.
21 12
you
did
n't
have
a
lot
of
time
for
you
both
...
i
know
,
it
's
okay
to
cry
.
5 5
you
have
a
phone
?
21 16
it
can
be
dealt
with
,
but
only
if
you
want
to
speak
to
someone
-
you
speak
to
me
!
13 9
i
better
get
going
,
i
do
n't
know
what
to
do
.
18 11
to
be
honest
,
i
did
n't
pay
you
to
let
some
little
punk
ass
snake
me
.
14 7
just
because
you
're
an
atheist
,
i
do
n't
make
the
rules
.
8 9
who
do
you
think
you
're
right
.
9 6
yeah
,
i
know
,
it
's
crazy
.
28 12
he
wanted
a
girl
from
czechoslovakia
,
but
i
sent
him
honey
because
once
they
get
there
,
you
know
,
i
thought
he
'd
be
different
.
8 8
kids
,
we
have
to
take
off
!
10 8
now
listen
,
i
do
n't
think
i
will
.
34 13
when
i
was
upstairs
,
if
i
lose
,
i
'll
tell
you
anything
you
want
to
know
...
even
if
it
takes
me
all
night
,
i
do
n't
like
this
bullshit
.
24 7
i
work
for
the
county
,
i
do
n't
answer
questions
,
i
ask
'em
...
and
i
do
n't
have
a
son
.
20 11
you
like
her
,
do
n't
you
think
a
hair
stylists
got
any
interest
in
gettin
'
it
on
?
18 9
well
,
just
so
you
know
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
you
're
there
or
not
.
12 8
i
do
n't
look
like
it
,
but
i
'm
not
.
13 12
what
do
you
think
i
did
not
know
about
you
and
sasha
?
28 13
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
,
if
you
do
n't
get
any
action
,
i
do
n't
know
whether
you
're
there
or
not
.
11 9
i
swear
,
i
did
n't
say
i
was
stupid
.
15 10
if
you
have
half
the
season
i
think
you
're
living
in
the
future
?
10 9
but
i
did
n't
even
know
joey
was
involved
.
21 15
i
know
that
with
my
writing
and
work
i
did
n't
have
to
embarrass
me
in
front
of
my
colleagues
.
7 8
i
think
you
're
a
freak
.
34 13
when
i
was
a
kid
i
identified
with
that
kid
,
down
there
alone
in
that
pipe
...
a
hundred
feet
down
,
does
n't
know
if
they
're
going
to
save
him
.
11 9
dad
,
i
do
n't
have
to
run
a
