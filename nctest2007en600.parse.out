Europe
's
Divided
Racial
House
A
common
feature
of
Europe
's
extreme
right
is
its
racism
and
use
of
the
immigration
issue
as
a
political
wedge
.
49 12
The
Lega
Nord
in
Italy
,
the
Vlaams
Blok
in
the
Netherlands
,
the
supporters
of
Le
Pen
's
National
Front
in
France
,
are
all
examples
of
parties
or
movements
formed
on
the
common
theme
of
aversion
to
immigrants
and
promotion
of
simplistic
policies
to
control
them
.
31 11
While
individuals
like
Jorg
Haidar
and
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
may
come
and
-LRB-
never
to
soon
-RRB-
go
,
the
race
question
will
not
disappear
from
European
politics
anytime
soon
.
18 8
An
aging
population
at
home
and
ever
more
open
borders
imply
increasing
racial
fragmentation
in
European
countries
.
30 13
Mainstream
parties
of
the
center
left
and
center
right
have
confronted
this
prospect
by
hiding
their
heads
in
the
ground
,
hoping
against
hope
that
the
problem
will
disappear
.
12 8
It
will
not
,
as
America
's
racial
history
clearly
shows
.
44 16
Race
relations
in
the
US
have
been
for
decades
-
and
remain
-
at
the
center
of
political
debate
,
to
the
point
that
racial
cleavages
are
as
important
as
income
,
if
not
more
,
as
determinants
of
political
preferences
and
attitudes
.
26 13
The
first
step
to
address
racial
politics
is
to
understand
the
origin
and
consequences
of
racial
animosity
,
even
if
it
means
uncovering
unpleasant
truths
.
24 12
This
is
precisely
what
a
large
amount
of
research
in
economics
,
sociology
,
psychology
and
political
science
has
done
for
the
US
.
55 17
This
research
shows
that
people
of
different
races
trust
each
other
much
less
;
whites
are
less
willing
to
support
welfare
spending
because
it
is
perceived
to
favor
minorities
;
more
racially
fragmented
communities
have
less
efficient
governments
,
more
corruption
and
patronage
,
more
crime
and
fewer
productive
public
goods
per
tax
dollar
.
40 15
This
does
not
mean
that
the
answer
is
to
eliminate
heterogeneity
and
create
racially
homogenous
communities
,
but
an
acknowledgment
of
the
reality
of
these
issues
is
needed
in
order
to
start
constructing
solid
public
policies
toward
race
relations
.
11 10
Of
course
,
Americans
disagree
on
how
to
do
this
.
21 14
Some
favor
affirmative
action
programs
that
provide
preferences
for
minorities
in
job
allocation
,
college
admission
,
and
public
contracts
.
31 12
These
policies
are
seen
as
a
way
of
offering
reparation
for
past
injustices
and
,
more
importantly
,
for
creating
role
models
and
for
overcoming
residual
and
perhaps
involuntary
discrimination
.
37 20
Others
object
to
affirmative
action
,
and
argue
that
a
race-blind
policy
coupled
with
free
market
polices
and
pro-family
values
are
all
that
are
necessary
to
create
jobs
for
minorities
and
help
keep
black
families
together
.
39 18
The
latter
is
a
crucial
in
any
policy
,
since
one
of
the
single
most
important
causes
of
poverty
in
the
US
is
the
diffusion
of
single
parents
-LRB-
read
single
mother
-RRB-
households
in
the
black
community
.
24 14
Regardless
of
the
correct
answer
,
the
point
is
that
determining
what
to
do
about
race
is
a
dominant
issue
in
US
politics
.
14 8
Of
course
,
minorities
have
made
progress
towards
more
integration
and
economic
success
.
26 11
In
the
1950s
blacks
could
not
sit
in
the
front
of
busses
,
today
two
of
the
main
players
in
US
foreign
politics
are
blacks
.
20 8
To
be
sure
,
right
wing
American
politicians
continue
deploy
the
``
race
card
''
as
a
tactical
tool
.
23 11
Take
the
case
of
Patrick
Buchanan
the
former
Nixon
and
Reagan
aid
who
became
an
independent
presidential
candidate
in
the
last
election
.
27 10
He
recently
published
a
successful
book
entitled
''
The
Death
of
the
West
:
How
Dying
Populations
and
Immigrant
Invasion
Imperil
Our
Country
and
Civilization
.
''
20 10
But
for
every
book
like
this
there
are
ten
others
with
a
serious
analysis
of
America
's
race
question
.
13 7
Policy
analysis
and
debates
about
race
relations
lag
terribly
behind
in
Europe
.
35 14
At
most
the
question
is
dealt
with
narrowly
,
in
terms
of
immigration
quotas
and
border
restrictions
,
not
in
terms
of
the
social
problems
and
opportunities
created
by
an
increasingly
racially
mixed
Europe
.
19 11
Of
course
,
a
clear
immigration
policy
is
needed
in
order
to
avoid
the
accumulation
of
illegal
immigrants
.
26 10
But
this
can
not
be
the
end
of
it
:
border
controls
with
Mexico
are
not
the
end
of
American
policy
towards
domestic
race
issues
!
35 13
Europe
is
rich
and
rapidly
aging
;
Europeans
,
cushioned
by
generous
welfare
programs
,
are
no
longer
prepared
to
accept
``
dirty
jobs
''
in
,
say
,
agriculture
or
the
leather
industry
.
8 7
This
makes
an
increase
in
immigration
unavoidable
.
28 13
Europeans
,
however
,
are
prompt
to
criticize
the
US
for
any
failure
in
their
policy
toward
minorities
and
for
any
manifestation
of
racism
across
the
Atlantic
.
42 8
Reading
the
European
press
one
often
perceives
a
superiority
complex
towards
the
US
over
racial
issues
:
they
,
the
Americans
,
have
problems
with
racism
;
we
are
immune
from
it
,
except
for
crazed
neo-Nazi
skinheads
and
their
like
.
53 13
What
has
happened
in
recent
weeks
,
from
Paris
to
Amsterdam
,
shows
that
the
race
problem
in
Europe
is
much
deeper
and
,
as
in
the
US
,
stems
from
the
sad
truth
that
race
relations
are
inherently
difficult
and
trust
and
cooperative
behavior
does
not
travel
well
across
racial
lines
.
47 14
If
Europe
's
mainstream
parties
do
not
begin
a
more
serious
investment
in
understanding
racial
tensions
in
Europe
and
put
``
race
''
as
one
of
their
main
priorities
,
individuals
like
Le
Pen
are
bound
to
try
filling
the
void
with
their
message
of
hate
.
30 16
Fighting
the
French
Exception
Europe
's
attention
nowadays
is
rightly
focused
on
enlargement
and
on
the
constitution
that
is
currently
being
worked
out
between
the
EU
's
member
states
.
27 13
But
the
outcome
of
several
Gallic
skirmishes
with
the
European
Commission
will
be
no
less
important
in
determining
the
fate
of
the
new
and
enlarged
Europe
.
25 15
France
has
unilaterally
chosen
to
ignore
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
by
running
a
predicted
deficit
well
above
the
3
%
of
GDP
limit
.
26 11
The
French
like
to
acclaim
the
rational
rigour
of
their
thinking
,
but
where
budgets
are
concerned
,
Descartes
is
out
and
obfuscation
is
in
.
37 15
France
was
among
the
leading
critics
of
Ireland
,
when
,
in
2000
,
the
Irish
government
reduced
its
budget
surplus
,
which
then
stood
at
4
%
of
GDP
,
by
a
mere
0.5
%
.
22 11
Other
countries
have
violated
the
Stability
Pact
,
but
France
is
the
first
to
do
it
with
smirking
,
open
defiance
.
7 6
None
of
this
should
surprise
anyone
.
18 14
France
is
simply
applying
to
EU
rules
its
engrained
habit
of
viewing
its
own
culture
as
exceptional
.
14 7
For
example
,
France
consistently
vetoes
reforms
of
the
EU
Common
Agricultural
Policy
.
36 14
As
even
children
know
,
the
CAP
is
a
handsome
and
totally
undeserved
present
to
wealthy
European
-LRB-
especially
French
-RRB-
farmers
at
the
expense
of
the
struggling
farmers
of
developing
countries
and
EU
consumers
.
25 20
France
is
also
trying
to
return
to
old
policies
of
bailing
out
unprofitable
private
companies
on
the
verge
of
collapse
with
taxpayers
'
money
.
32 14
The
EU
Commissioner
for
Competition
Policy
,
Mario
Monti
,
can
not
loose
this
battle
:
he
needs
the
support
of
those
who
believe
in
markets
and
equal
treatment
for
all
.
6 5
Here
the
story
is
simple
.
34 16
The
French
government
plans
to
bail
out
Alstom
,
a
company
that
developed
a
number
of
high-tech
products
,
including
the
TGV
,
the
French
fast
train
,
but
recently
went
into
bankruptcy
.
34 18
The
French
government
claims
that
it
will
never
back
down
from
its
plan
to
rescue
Alstom
,
a
plan
with
all
the
familiar
dirigiste
motivations
:
maintaining
employment
,
protecting
investors
,
etc.
.
31 12
In
addition
,
since
Alstom
is
a
high
tech
firm
,
the
French
government
plays
the
research
and
development
card
,
arguing
that
investment
in
R&D
is
good
for
growth
.
10 8
Saving
Alstom
by
nationalizing
the
company
is
obviously
wrong
.
25 9
The
company
consists
of
many
different
parts
,
some
profitable
,
others
bankrupt
:
the
obvious
thing
to
do
is
to
break
it
up
.
21 7
The
profitable
parts
,
such
as
the
TGV
,
will
easily
find
buyers
;
the
unprofitable
plants
should
be
closed
.
23 12
French
taxpayers
'
money
is
better
spent
on
temporary
benefits
for
displaced
workers
than
on
subsidies
to
keep
an
unprofitable
plant
alive
.
32 19
It
is
important
that
the
European
Commission
not
allow
France
to
carve
out
special
rules
for
itself
in
competition
policy
,
as
it
appears
to
be
doing
with
its
budget
deficits
.
25 10
The
Commission
must
strike
down
public
aid
to
private
companies
in
France
as
it
strikes
such
subsidies
down
in
any
other
EU
member
state
.
22 12
The
Commission
has
already
achieved
some
success
on
this
front
,
notably
forcing
Germany
to
cancel
government
guarantees
on
public
banks
.
21 9
Alstom
in
particular
and
France
in
general
should
not
be
an
exception
and
should
be
held
to
the
same
standards
.
21 9
If
the
Commission
fails
to
act
,
the
EU
will
look
even
more
like
a
playground
for
French
public
servants
.
31 12
France
has
already
taken
a
leading
role
in
EU
foreign
policy
,
with
Foreign
Minister
Dominique
de
Villepin
looking
and
acting
more
and
more
like
the
foreign
minister
of
Europe
.
19 8
At
the
same
time
France
violates
key
rules
of
common
economic
policy
and
public
aid
to
private
companies
.
20 10
Will
the
European
Commission
lose
what
remains
of
its
credibility
and
end
up
looking
like
a
minor
Parisian
arrondissment
?
18 9
A
defeat
on
Alstom
would
have
profound
consequences
in
Europe
--
and
not
only
for
competition
policy
.
60 16
The
War
for
Oil
For
decades
,
through
Democratic
and
Republican
presidential
administrations
,
America
has
pursued
a
set
of
straightforward
energy
policy
objectives
:
keep
world
oil
prices
as
stable
as
possible
;
reduce
domestic
consumption
of
oil
as
painlessly
as
possible
;
reduce
dependence
on
foreign
imports
whenever
possible
;
and
diversify
the
sources
of
imported
oil
.
14 7
Despite
appearances
,
none
of
these
objectives
has
changed
under
the
Bush
administration
.
25 18
Many
observers
believe
that
Bush
has
set
a
new
course
because
the
invasion
of
Iraq
seems
to
fly
in
the
face
of
these
objectives
.
35 14
A
big
increase
in
Iraq
's
oil
production
would
probably
increase
US
dependence
on
oil
relative
to
other
energy
sources
,
as
world
oil
prices
will
probably
fall
in
response
to
the
additional
supplies
.
22 8
This
,
in
turn
,
would
mean
an
increase
in
US
dependence
on
imported
oil
,
especially
from
the
Middle
East
.
54 16
The
irony
,
however
,
is
that
the
US
exercised
greater
control
over
the
Iraqi
oil
sector
under
the
UN
's
pre-war
``
Oil-for-Food
Program
''
-LRB-
in
which
the
UN
,
not
Saddam
Hussein
,
determined
the
level
of
Iraqi
oil
sales
abroad
-RRB-
than
it
will
in
any
future
democratic
Iraq
.
38 9
If
the
Bush
administration
was
seeking
stable
,
secure
,
diverse
and
cheap
oil
supplies
,
it
could
have
simply
lifted
the
embargos
on
Libya
,
Iran
,
Iraq
,
and
Sudan
and
let
the
oil
gush
.
17 7
But
America
's
interest
in
Iraqi
oil
was
not
driven
either
by
economics
or
energy
policy
.
17 8
The
Bush
administration
recognized
that
,
above
all
,
Iraqi
oil
is
a
critical
geopolitical
asset
.
7 7
Whoever
controls
Iraqi
oil
controls
Iraq
.
16 9
Saddam
's
power
came
from
his
control
of
the
world
's
second
largest
oil
reserve
.
12 9
He
understood
perfectly
the
role
that
oil
played
in
his
power
.
18 9
Faced
with
the
possibility
of
invasion
and
defeat
,
Saddam
threatened
to
burn
Iraq
's
oil
fields
.
26 10
Much
of
the
subsequent
destruction
and
looting
of
Iraqi
oil
facilities
and
pipelines
reflects
the
widespread
realization
that
control
of
oil
means
control
of
Iraq
.
16 9
As
the
US
planned
its
invasion
,
securing
the
oil
fields
became
a
critical
priority
.
30 10
The
goal
was
not
increased
supplies
or
reduced
prices
for
Americans
,
but
stripping
Saddam
of
his
power
and
,
ultimately
,
establishing
and
solidifying
a
new
Iraqi
government
.
13 8
Iraq
's
future
depends
directly
on
the
fate
of
Iraqi
oil
production
.
38 19
Yet
the
vagaries
of
the
oil
business
,
particularly
in
such
unsettled
conditions
,
make
it
hard
to
see
how
the
Bush
administration
will
be
able
to
achieve
its
goals
in
Iraq
within
the
next
few
years
.
5 5
The
logic
is
simple
.
20 13
The
US
must
use
oil
revenues
to
lift
the
burden
of
financing
regime
change
in
Iraq
from
American
taxpayers
.
20 11
All
reconstruction
plans
depend
in
the
long
run
on
the
ability
of
Iraq
to
export
oil
in
large
quantities
.
30 8
If
Iraq
does
not
deliver
its
oil
,
President
Bush
can
not
deliver
on
his
promises
to
the
Iraqi
people
,
the
American
people
,
or
the
world
community
.
16 7
Before
the
invasion
,
Iraq
's
oil
production
capacity
reached
three
million
barrels
per
day
.
23 16
Iraq
will
not
be
able
to
increase
its
production
to
that
level
within
the
time
frame
needed
to
establish
an
Iraqi
government
.
27 13
Any
increase
in
Iraqi
oil
production
requires
developing
the
oil
fields
,
which
means
big
investments
,
a
legal
and
representative
government
,
and
political
stability
.
13 9
Not
even
the
Bush
administration
expects
these
requirements
to
be
met
soon
.
13 7
Indeed
,
political
stability
is
the
main
condition
for
increasing
production
capacity
.
42 14
Historical
evidence
from
Iran
,
Kuwait
,
Russia
,
and
even
Iraq
itself
,
indicates
that
it
takes
about
three
years
from
the
re-establishment
of
political
stability
for
capacity
to
increase
significantly
and
for
those
new
higher
levels
to
be
sustained
.
41 12
Iraq
needs
several
years
to
write
a
new
constitution
,
establish
a
legitimate
and
democratic
government
,
negotiate
the
distribution
of
oil
revenues
among
its
various
regions
,
enact
new
investment
laws
,
and
make
the
economy
attractive
to
foreigners
.
34 11
It
also
needs
time
to
negotiate
with
the
international
oil
companies
and
neighboring
countries
,
to
perform
technical
and
feasibility
studies
,
and
to
reconstruct
,
rehabilitate
,
and
explore
its
oil
fields
.
38 13
So
even
a
three-year
time
frame
seems
optimistic
,
for
it
assumes
that
within
that
period
,
the
occupation
will
end
,
Iraqis
will
establish
their
own
democratic
government
,
and
that
political
stability
will
be
achieved
.
11 8
Needless
to
say
,
the
situation
may
play
out
differently
.
7 7
Tensions
may
remain
high
for
years
.
21 11
No
one
should
be
surprised
,
moreover
,
if
Iraqi
oil
production
suddenly
stops
altogether
even
under
a
democratic
government
.
24 13
History
suggests
that
labor
strikes
and
similar
disruptions
that
can
halt
oil
production
are
a
greater
threat
in
democratic
than
in
undemocratic
countries
.
25 9
If
Iraq
can
not
quickly
increase
its
production
capacity
in
the
next
few
years
,
this
will
hinder
both
US
foreign
and
energy
policies
.
11 8
How
will
the
US
finance
the
long-term
reconstruction
of
Iraq
?
10 10
Who
will
pay
to
maintain
a
fragile
Iraqi
democracy
?
25 11
Can
the
US
sustain
its
occupation
if
it
can
not
provide
food
,
health
care
,
and
other
basic
services
to
Iraq
's
people
?
29 13
These
are
tough
questions
,
and
they
are
fundamentally
unanswerable
until
a
stable
,
democratic
regime
in
Iraq
can
control
and
ensure
a
steady
flow
of
oil
exports
.

Letting
Killers
Guard
Human
Rights
If
it
were
not
so
profoundly
sad
,
it
would
qualify
as
the
sick
joke
of
the
millennium
:
Libya
has
been
elected
to
chair
the
United
Nations
Commission
on
Human
Rights
!
21 8
When
Caligula
appointed
his
horse
to
the
Senate
,
the
horse
at
least
did
not
have
blood
on
its
hoofs
.
22 9
The
procedure
,
of
course
,
was
perfectly
legal
:
the
chairmanship
rotates
every
year
from
one
global
region
to
another
.
17 10
This
year
it
was
Africa
's
turn
to
nominate
the
chairman
,
and
they
nominated
Libya
.
8 5
Only
the
US
and
Canada
voted
against
.
9 5
To
their
everlasting
shame
,
European
countries
abstained
.
25 11
It
is
a
telling
commentary
on
the
moral
bankruptcy
of
the
UN
that
this
decision
comes
at
so
delicate
a
time
for
the
organization
.
52 22
President
Bush
has
challenged
the
UN
to
show
its
seriousness
about
its
own
mandatory
decisions
about
Iraq
:
otherwise
it
may
meet
the
same
ignominious
end
as
the
League
of
Nations
,
which
proved
impotent
in
the
1930
's
when
confronted
with
the
aggressive
policies
of
Nazi
Germany
and
fascist
Italy
.
31 15
To
have
Libya
elected
at
this
moment
to
chair
the
UN
body
responsible
for
human
rights
hardly
helps
support
either
the
legitimacy
or
the
moral
authority
of
the
world
body
.
31 13
Let
us
remember
:
Libya
is
a
totalitarian
tyranny
;
its
leader
,
Muammar
Ghaddafi
,
combines
sometimes
erratic
behavior
with
extremist
policies
,
supporting
dictators
all
over
the
world
.
25 11
He
heads
one
of
the
world
's
most
oppressive
regimes
,
where
there
is
no
pretense
at
elections
and
where
dissent
is
instantly
crushed
.
20 8
Under
his
rule
,
Libya
has
supported
terrorist
organizations
worldwide
--
from
the
IRA
to
various
Palestinian
extremist
groups
.
26 12
It
remains
under
UN
sanctions
for
its
role
in
the
downing
of
a
Pan
Am
passenger
flight
over
Lockerbie
,
Scotland
,
a
decade
ago
.
26 12
In
the
last
decade
,
the
position
of
the
UN
as
a
symbol
of
the
ideals
of
a
peaceful
world
community
has
been
steadily
eroded
.
47 11
It
proved
utterly
unable
to
stop
the
wars
in
the
Balkans
;
and
in
at
least
one
case
--
Srebrenica
--
a
Dutch
UN
peacekeeping
force
stood
by
and
witnessed
the
worst
massacre
in
post-1945
Europe
,
as
Bosnian
Serbs
murdered
around
6,000
defenseless
Muslim
men
.
23 11
A
Dutch
commission
of
enquiry
later
admitted
that
the
UN
Dutch
battalion
was
,
in
fact
,
complicit
in
that
war
crime
.
40 12
In
Rwanda
,
once
the
genocide
started
,
the
UN
official
responsible
for
peacekeeping
operations
ordered
the
evacuation
of
UN
forces
from
the
country
,
leaving
the
field
wide
open
to
the
bloodiest
genocidal
massacre
since
World
War
II
.
9 5
That
UN
official
's
name
is
Kofi
Annan
.
37 19
It
is
a
depressing
,
pathetic
record
,
which
the
UN
is
trying
--
probably
in
vain
--
to
redeem
by
appearing
,
in
the
Iraq
crisis
,
as
the
voice
of
reason
and
international
legitimacy
.
51 17
But
at
a
time
when
UN
inspections
in
Iraq
seem
like
sending
the
Salvation
Army
to
clear
out
a
band
of
gangsters
,
raising
Libya
to
head
the
Human
Rights
Commission
may
go
down
in
history
as
the
definitive
failure
of
an
organization
whose
life
started
with
so
much
hope
.
26 17
Organizations
usually
do
n't
die
--
and
certainly
there
is
too
much
raison
d'etat
to
make
certain
that
the
UN
will
continue
to
hobble
on
.
17 12
But
it
will
be
a
mere
shadow
of
what
it
should
,
and
could
,
be
.
9 5
Today
's
UN
gives
hypocrisy
a
bad
name
.
22 7
Authoritarians
at
the
Gate
Last
Thursday
,
judges
at
Indonesia
's
Central
Jakarta
Court
sentenced
me
to
one
year
in
prison
.
49 21
As
the
editor-in-chief
of
Tempo
Weekly
Newsmagazine
,
I
am
guilty
,
according
to
the
court
,
of
defaming
a
business
tycoon
named
Tomy
Winata
by
implying
his
possible
involvement
in
a
fire
at
Jakarta
's
South-East
Asia
textile
market
,
and
of
fomenting
riots
by
disseminating
lies
.
22 9
Does
my
case
,
and
others
like
it
,
portend
the
end
of
yet
another
short-lived
experiment
with
democracy
in
Indonesia
?
45 15
The
``
riot
''
that
I
allegedly
fomented
occurred
in
March
last
year
,
when
almost
two
hundred
thugs
claiming
to
be
Winata
's
followers
attacked
Tempo
's
office
,
threatened
to
burn
down
the
building
,
harassed
staff
,
and
injured
one
reporter
.
33 11
Trying
to
help
resolve
the
situation
peacefully
,
I
was
persuaded
to
negotiate
at
the
Central
Jakarta
Police
Station
,
but
found
to
my
horror
that
the
mob
leaders
controlled
the
station
.
13 9
I
was
punched
and
kicked
as
the
police
looked
the
other
way
.
15 6
Fortunately
,
many
journalists
came
to
our
rescue
with
tape
recorders
and
cameras
rolling
.
17 13
Their
broadcasts
caused
a
public
outcry
,
which
forced
our
parliament
to
organize
a
public
hearing
.
24 7
The
National
and
Jakarta
police
chiefs
were
called
and
,
under
massive
public
pressure
,
the
leaders
of
the
mob
were
criminally
charged
.
22 12
But
Winata
himself
eluded
police
investigation
,
merely
by
claiming
publicly
that
his
followers
acted
without
his
prior
knowledge
and
consent
.
29 15
He
then
filed
criminal
charges
of
his
own
,
against
Ahmad
Taufik
,
who
wrote
the
article
,
Teuku
Iskandar
Ali
,
who
edited
it
,
and
me
.
17 9
The
yearlong
court
proceedings
were
marked
by
a
series
of
suspicious
developments
,
all
favoring
Winata
.
25 13
First
,
the
case
built
by
the
police
and
state
prosecutor
contained
documents
that
were
so
blatantly
falsified
that
the
police
indicted
two
officers
.
22 14
But
the
court
rejected
our
request
that
proceedings
be
delayed
until
the
legality
of
the
state
's
case
could
be
clarified
.
12 9
The
case
against
the
officers
involved
appears
to
be
going
nowhere
.
23 13
On
the
contrary
,
one
of
them
has
been
promoted
to
command
the
newly
formed
-LRB-
and
US-funded
-RRB-
Jakarta
Anti-Terror
Unit
.
15 10
The
other
has
reportedly
been
sent
to
the
police
staff
school
for
advanced
training
.
33 12
Then
,
in
the
sixth
month
of
the
case
,
the
Head
Judge
in
the
three-judge
panel
was
suddenly
promoted
to
become
the
head
of
a
city
court
an
hour
from
Jakarta
.
28 12
One
of
my
lawyers
noted
that
in
his
35
years
experience
at
the
court
,
he
had
never
seen
a
Head
Judge
replaced
in
an
ongoing
case
.
20 10
In
fact
,
despite
her
promotion
,
the
judge
continued
to
preside
over
another
case
in
the
same
building
.
17 13
A
judge
who
had
previously
ruled
against
Tempo
in
Winata
's
civil
suit
filled
her
vacancy
.
17 12
Finally
,
when
Winata
testified
,
he
perjured
himself
by
denying
that
Tempo
had
interviewed
him
.
61 13
A
recording
of
the
telephone
interview
was
played
in
court
;
sworn
testimony
was
heard
from
the
reporter
who
conducted
the
interview
and
from
two
editors
who
witnessed
it
;
the
official
record
from
the
telephone
company
was
submitted
as
evidence
of
the
call
;
and
an
expert
witness
concluded
that
the
voice
on
the
recording
belonged
to
Tomy
Winata
.
29 14
But
the
judges
denied
Tempo
's
request
that
Winata
be
arrested
and
tried
for
perjury
,
telling
us
to
report
it
to
the
police
,
which
we
did
.
22 8
The
judges
then
denied
our
request
for
a
postponement
of
the
court
decision
until
Mr.
Winata
's
perjury
case
was
resolved
.
15 6
Given
such
flawed
proceedings
,
my
conviction
and
prison
sentence
come
as
no
surprise
.
20 11
But
I
remain
hopeful
that
we
will
prevail
in
the
end
,
when
higher
courts
hear
Tempo
's
appeal
.
26 8
Indonesia
's
courts
are
cleaner
at
the
top
,
and
the
Head
of
the
Supreme
Court
is
a
staunch
advocate
of
democracy
and
press
freedom
.
28 9
Tempo
's
case
could
become
a
landmark
victory
for
our
democracy
,
like
the
US
Supreme
Court
's
famous
decision
in
The
New
York
Times
v.
Sullivan
.
20 10
By
raising
the
bar
for
defamation
charges
,
that
decision
ensures
that
American
journalists
can
hold
public
officials
accountable
.
31 11
No
country
knows
better
than
Indonesia
that
free
speech
and
a
free
press
are
proven
indicators
of
democratic
development
,
and
that
criminalizing
journalists
is
an
early
symptom
of
authoritarianism
.
28 13
Indonesia
was
a
liberal
democracy
in
the
1950
's
,
before
President
Sukarno
,
supported
by
the
military
,
began
a
crackdown
on
the
press
in
1956
.
26 10
With
critical
voices
silenced
,
consolidating
unchecked
power
became
easier
and
,
in
July
1959
,
Sukarno
decreed
the
beginning
of
``
Guided
Democracy
.
''
34 9
For
the
first
few
years
after
Sukarno
's
fall
in
1966
,
all
the
benefits
of
genuine
democracy
,
including
freedom
of
the
press
,
were
restored
-LRB-
except
for
the
communists
-RRB-
.
24 8
But
President
Suharto
's
regime
began
another
press
crackdown
in
the
early
1970
's
,
ultimately
banning
various
media
and
jailing
many
journalists
.
18 7
With
the
press
under
control
,
other
political
rights
were
quickly
curtailed
and
Indonesian
democracy
failed
again
.
27 9
Since
Suharto
's
fall
in
1998
,
Indonesia
has
become
the
third
largest
democratic
country
in
the
world
and
the
largest
democratic
Muslim
community
in
history
.
32 11
Two
parliamentary
elections
and
two
direct
presidential
elections
-
including
the
latest
presidential
run-off
-
have
been
free
,
fair
,
and
peaceful
,
proving
that
Islam
and
democracy
can
coexist
.
9 5
Democracy
's
enemies
,
however
,
never
rest
.
25 12
Radical
Islamic
groups
have
engaged
in
indiscriminate
bombings
,
while
groups
with
strong
authoritarian
tendencies
have
made
inroads
into
President
Megawati
's
inner
circle
.
13 10
But
Mrs
Megawati
has
just
been
defeated
in
her
bid
for
reelection
.
10 8
Will
newly
elected
President
Susilo
continue
to
prosecute
journalists
?
26 10
Will
my
conviction
,
and
the
trials
and
convictions
of
other
journalists
,
mark
the
beginning
of
the
end
of
Indonesia
's
hard-won
third
democracy
?
16 10
The
answer
lies
in
the
support
that
Indonesian
pro-democracy
activists
can
generate
domestically
and
internationally
.
25 14
To
lose
Indonesia
-
a
potential
beacon
of
hope
to
all
pro-democracy
activists
in
the
world
Muslim
community
-
would
be
a
terrible
defeat
.
18 11
The
Morality
of
Capital
Punishment
The
US
is
often
criticized
for
its
refusal
to
abolish
capital
punishment
.
17 10
Many
now
claim
that
abolition
of
capital
punishment
is
a
precondition
of
a
civilized
criminal-law
system
.
6 4
Nobel
laureate
Gary
Becker
disagrees
.
28 8
European
governments
are
adamantly
opposed
to
capital
punishment
--
the
European
Union
bans
it
outright
--
and
some
Europeans
consider
its
use
in
the
United
States
barbaric
.
22 10
Indeed
,
many
European
intellectuals
argue
that
not
just
capital
punishment
,
but
punishment
in
general
,
does
not
deter
criminals
.
44 14
But
,
whereas
Europeans
,
with
crime
rates
well
below
American
rates
for
the
past
half-century
,
could
long
afford
to
be
relatively
``
soft
''
on
most
crimes
,
they
have
seen
their
crime
rates
increase
sharply
during
the
past
twenty
years
.
17 11
By
contrast
,
American
rates
have
fallen
,
in
part
because
of
greater
use
of
punishment
.
5 5
This
includes
capital
punishment
.
22 14
I
support
executing
some
people
convicted
of
murder
because
--
and
only
because
--
I
believe
that
it
deters
other
murders
.
28 12
If
I
did
not
believe
that
,
I
would
oppose
capital
punishment
,
because
revenge
and
other
possible
motives
should
not
be
a
basis
for
public
policy
.
27 9
Serious
empirical
research
on
capital
punishment
in
the
US
began
with
a
pioneering
study
by
Isaac
Ehrlich
,
published
in
1975
in
the
American
Economic
Review
.
21 11
Some
subsequent
studies
have
sometimes
found
a
much
weaker
deterrent
effect
,
while
others
have
found
a
much
stronger
effect
.
22 8
The
available
data
are
quite
limited
,
however
,
so
one
should
not
base
any
conclusions
solely
on
the
econometric
evidence
.
17 9
Of
course
,
public
policy
on
any
punishment
can
not
wait
until
the
evidence
is
perfect
.
21 11
But
,
even
with
the
limited
quantitative
evidence
available
,
there
are
good
reasons
to
believe
that
capital
punishment
deters
.
27 15
Most
people
,
and
murderers
in
particular
,
fear
death
,
especially
when
it
follows
swiftly
and
with
considerable
certainty
following
the
commission
of
a
murder
.
23 10
As
David
Hume
put
it
in
discussing
suicide
,
``
no
man
ever
threw
away
life
,
while
it
was
worth
living
.
45 17
For
such
is
our
natural
horror
of
death
...
''
Likewise
,
Schopenhauer
believed
that
``
as
soon
as
the
terrors
of
life
reach
a
point
at
which
they
outweigh
the
terrors
of
death
,
a
man
will
put
an
end
to
his
life
.
37 18
But
the
terrors
of
death
offer
considerable
resistance
...
''
Opponents
of
capital
punishment
frequently
proclaim
that
the
state
has
no
moral
right
to
take
anyone
's
life
,
including
that
of
the
most
reprehensible
murderer
.
16 11
Yet
that
is
absolutely
the
wrong
conclusion
for
anyone
who
believes
that
capital
punishment
deters
.
48 17
To
see
why
,
suppose
that
for
each
murderer
executed
-LRB-
instead
of
,
say
,
receiving
life
imprisonment
-RRB-
,
the
number
of
murders
is
reduced
by
three
,
which
is
a
much
lower
number
than
Ehrlich
's
and
some
other
estimates
of
the
deterrent
effect
.
15 9
This
implies
that
for
each
murderer
not
executed
,
three
innocent
victims
would
die
.
21 13
In
fact
,
the
government
would
indirectly
be
``
taking
''
many
lives
if
it
did
not
use
capital
punishment
.
32 9
Saving
three
innocent
lives
for
every
person
executed
seems
like
a
very
attractive
trade-off
,
and
even
two
lives
saved
per
execution
seems
like
a
persuasive
benefit-cost
ratio
for
capital
punishment
.
24 13
Admittedly
,
however
,
the
argument
in
favor
of
capital
punishment
becomes
less
clear-cut
as
the
number
of
lives
saved
per
execution
falls
.
37 19
But
,
even
if
only
one
life
were
saved
per
execution
,
the
tradeoff
might
still
be
desirable
if
the
life
saved
is
much
better
than
the
life
taken
,
which
would
usually
be
the
case
.
16 12
Many
people
object
to
comparing
the
quality
of
the
life
spared
and
the
life
taken
.
12 10
Yet
I
do
not
see
how
to
avoid
such
a
comparison
.
24 15
Consider
a
career
criminal
who
robs
and
kills
a
victim
who
led
a
decent
life
and
left
several
children
and
a
spouse
behind
.
19 16
Suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
save
the
life
of
an
innocent
victim
by
executing
such
a
criminal
.
23 13
To
me
it
is
obvious
that
saving
such
a
victim
's
life
must
count
for
more
than
taking
the
criminal
's
life
.
27 9
Obviously
,
not
all
cases
are
so
unambiguous
,
but
a
comparison
of
the
qualities
of
individual
lives
must
be
part
of
any
reasonable
social
policy
.
19 13
This
helps
explain
why
capital
punishment
should
be
used
only
for
murders
,
and
not
for
lesser
crimes
.
24 9
When
the
tradeoff
is
between
taking
lives
and
,
say
,
reducing
property
theft
,
the
case
for
milder
punishments
is
far
stronger
.
34 10
Although
severe
assaults
,
including
some
gruesome
rapes
,
may
approach
some
murders
in
severity
,
and
might
conceivably
call
for
capital
punishment
,
I
do
not
support
its
use
in
these
cases
.
15 9
A
powerful
argument
for
reserving
capital
punishment
for
murders
is
``
marginal
deterrence
.
''
42 27
If
assault
were
punished
with
execution
,
perpetrators
would
have
an
incentive
to
kill
their
victims
to
avoid
discovery
-LRB-
which
is
a
major
reason
why
the
severity
of
punishments
more
generally
should
be
matched
to
the
severity
of
crimes
-RRB-
.
24 20
One
complication
is
that
capital
punishment
may
make
a
murderer
fight
harder
to
avoid
being
captured
,
which
could
lead
to
more
deaths
.
38 16
But
,
while
marginal
deterrence
is
important
,
I
believe
the
resistance
of
murderers
to
being
captured
,
possibly
at
the
expense
of
their
own
lives
,
is
really
indirect
evidence
that
criminals
do
fear
capital
punishment
.
13 10
Of
course
,
I
worry
about
the
risk
of
executing
the
innocent
.
24 13
My
support
for
capital
punishment
would
weaken
greatly
if
the
rate
of
killing
innocent
people
were
as
large
as
that
claimed
by
many
.
44 15
However
,
I
believe
that
the
appeal
process
in
the
US
offers
enormous
protection
,
not
so
much
against
wrongful
conviction
as
against
wrongful
execution
,
so
that
there
are
very
few
,
if
any
,
documented
cases
of
innocent
people
being
killed
.
14 10
And
this
process
has
been
strengthened
enormously
with
the
development
of
DNA
identification
.
23 15
Again
,
the
debate
about
capital
punishment
is
essentially
a
debate
about
deterrence
-LRB-
which
may
be
reduced
by
lengthy
appeals
-RRB-
.
29 20
I
can
understand
that
some
people
are
skeptical
about
the
evidence
,
although
I
believe
they
are
wrong
about
both
that
and
the
common
sense
of
the
issue
.
36 20
It
is
very
disturbing
to
take
someone
's
life
,
even
a
murderer
's
life
,
but
sometimes
highly
unpleasant
actions
are
necessary
to
prevent
even
worse
behavior
that
takes
the
lives
of
innocent
victims
.
21 9
The
People
Versus
Putin
I
helped
select
Vladimir
Putin
to
succeed
Russia
's
first
democratically
elected
President
,
Boris
Yeltsin
.
29 16
Because
KGB/Mafia
structures
now
rule
Russia
and
manipulate
the
judicial
system
,
it
is
assumed
that
Yeltsin
wanted
to
handpick
his
successor
in
order
to
avoid
future
prosecution
.
23 14
But
we
who
chose
Putin
were
charged
with
finding
someone
to
continue
Yeltsin
's
reforms
,
not
shield
him
and
his
family
.
26 10
Indeed
,
Yeltsin
was
fearless
,
and
sought
not
his
personal
survival
,
but
the
survival
of
the
democratic
idea
that
he
introduced
to
Russia
.
14 8
Yet
that
idea
is
now
under
threat
because
of
the
successor
we
chose
.
10 9
I
do
n't
deny
my
responsibility
for
supporting
Putin
.
23 8
We
were
n't
close
friends
,
but
he
and
I
worked
together
in
critical
situations
,
and
I
never
doubted
his
sincerity
.
7 7
Putin
acts
according
to
his
convictions
.
29 22
The
problem
is
that
his
convictions
--
including
his
belief
that
Russia
can
prosper
only
if
it
is
ruled
by
a
single
source
of
power
--
are
wrong
.
10 7
This
gross
error
is
leading
Russia
to
political
ruin
.
25 10
Of
course
,
no
one
holds
high
office
without
making
mistakes
,
even
fundamental
ones
,
and
this
is
especially
true
in
tumultuous
periods
.
11 6
Yeltsin
was
no
exception
,
but
he
recognized
his
errors
.
23 9
When
he
retired
on
New
Year
's
Eve
1999
,
for
example
,
he
asked
forgiveness
for
launching
the
war
in
Chechnya
.
29 11
Putin
,
by
contrast
,
seems
incapable
of
recognizing
and
admitting
his
mistakes
,
and
persists
in
a
policy
long
after
its
failure
is
visible
to
the
world
.
20 12
One
of
Yeltsin
's
errors
was
his
failure
to
put
moral
priorities
at
the
head
of
his
reform
agenda
.
11 9
Russia
should
have
repented
for
Stalinism
and
the
gulag
system
.
21 13
The
whole
nation
,
with
no
exception
,
should
have
repented
,
the
way
the
Germans
have
repented
since
1945
.
27 14
This
failure
matters
,
for
it
allowed
Putin
's
unqualified
belief
in
central
authority
to
lead
to
the
recapture
of
the
state
by
the
security
services
.
35 15
Indeed
,
a
direct
result
of
national
repentance
for
the
gulag
era
should
have
been
the
banning
of
the
communist
party
and
the
disqualification
from
political
office
of
those
who
worked
in
the
KGB
.
42 13
Although
such
political
screenings
are
complicated
in
postcommunist
societies
,
where
both
victimhood
and
collaboration
were
so
widespread
--
and
the
lines
between
them
so
often
blurred
--
a
sound
solution
could
have
been
found
,
as
in
the
Czech
Republic
.
22 8
Doing
nothing
left
Russia
's
security
structures
unscathed
and
able
to
make
a
political
comeback
,
which
they
have
now
achieved
.
27 9
The
political
resurrection
of
KGB
structures
under
Putin
,
and
their
efforts
to
silence
dissent
,
has
once
again
turned
Russia
into
a
country
of
defectors
.
35 23
It
is
impossible
to
silence
independent
politicians
and
independent
media
without
choking
off
independent
sources
of
money
,
which
is
why
Putin
's
Kremlin
has
concentrated
its
attacks
on
the
so-called
``
oligarchs
.
''
13 7
Mikhail
Khodorkovsky
's
arrest
and
trial
were
orchestrated
for
precisely
this
reason
.
23 9
By
removing
independent
sources
of
money
,
the
security
services
that
dominate
the
Kremlin
hope
to
destroy
independent
political
life
in
Russia
.
14 7
Without
independent
bases
of
thought
,
a
climate
of
fear
is
taking
hold
.
13 7
But
fear
is
not
only
degrading
;
it
makes
for
poor
governance
.
32 13
Yeltsin
intuitively
understood
that
fear
and
top-down
,
centralized
decision-making
were
no
way
to
rule
a
modern
country
,
and
he
therefore
insisted
on
reforming
relations
between
citizens
and
the
state
.
27 13
Putin
still
does
n't
understand
that
a
centralized
political
system
is
as
incapable
of
comprehending
and
correcting
mistakes
now
as
it
was
in
the
Soviet
era
.
29 14
Not
being
a
well-educated
man
Putin
is
,
in
full
and
deep
sincerity
,
leading
Russia
toward
the
same
disintegration
that
accompanied
the
collapse
of
the
Soviet
state
.
7 9
People
are
beginning
to
realize
this
.
45 23
They
see
that
Putin
's
desire
to
create
a
strong
and
effective
modern
state
can
not
be
realized
,
because
a
modern
state
is
governed
not
from
above
,
but
by
an
informed
citizenry
that
forces
its
rulers
to
acknowledge
and
correct
their
mistakes
.
13 9
Putin
,
too
,
also
seems
to
suspect
his
regime
's
impotence
.
36 19
This
is
one
reason
why
Russia
has
become
so
aggressive
with
its
neighbors
,
Ukraine
and
Georgia
,
and
seeks
to
maintain
a
military
presence
in
places
like
Transdniestria
,
the
breakaway
region
of
Moldova
.
25 10
By
throwing
its
weight
around
in
Russia
's
near
abroad
,
the
Kremlin
thinks
that
it
can
convince
Russians
back
home
of
its
omnipotence
.
35 16
Given
the
neutered
debates
in
Russia
,
and
the
Kremlin
's
ability
to
manipulate
elections
,
regime
change
is
the
only
option
left
for
those
who
want
to
preserve
the
democratic
idea
in
Russia
.
8 8
There
is
no
use
holding
onto
illusions
.
37 24
Those
who
oppose
Putin
must
decide
what
they
want
and
declare
that
,
if
the
regime
fails
to
uphold
the
constitution
,
they
have
the
right
to
force
it
to
do
so
by
any
means
necessary
.
19 8
Today
,
the
question
of
power
in
Russia
can
no
longer
be
decided
solely
at
the
ballot
box
.
17 8
As
in
Ukraine
,
Lebanon
,
and
Kyrgizstan
,
it
will
be
decided
in
the
streets
.
15 10
Tax
and
spend
-LRB-
Please
-RRB-
Excessive
taxation
can
dull
incentives
and
hinder
growth
.
9 6
But
too
little
taxation
can
do
the
same
.
12 6
Governments
with
meager
tax
revenues
ca
n't
provide
basic
public
goods
.
30 13
Worse
yet
,
low
tax
revenues
in
poor
countries
often
result
from
defects
in
tax
collection
systems
-LRB-
rather
than
low
tax
rates
-RRB-
that
also
promote
unproductive
enterprise
.
10 7
India
illustrates
the
importance
of
a
well-designed
tax
system
.
19 9
In
Bangalore
,
high-tech
companies
have
built
world-class
campuses
replete
with
manicured
lawns
and
high-speed
data
communication
networks
.
19 8
Outside
these
campuses
,
however
,
lie
open
sewers
,
uncollected
garbage
,
and
roads
in
acute
disrepair
.
21 11
Whereas
technology
companies
instantaneously
transmit
terabytes
of
data
to
remote
continents
,
local
transport
proceeds
at
an
almost
medieval
pace
.
33 12
As
a
result
,
businesses
in
Bangalore
run
their
own
bus
services
,
contract
with
private
suppliers
for
drinking
water
,
and
install
generators
to
protect
themselves
from
interruptions
in
electricity
supply
.
12 9
The
state
ca
n't
fix
the
shambles
because
it
is
broke
.
22 9
India
's
government
debt
exceeds
70
%
of
GDP
,
so
more
than
half
its
tax
receipts
go
to
paying
interest
.
13 8
But
the
debt
is
n't
because
of
excessive
spending
in
the
past
.
26 13
India
's
government
expenditures
amount
to
about
15
%
of
GDP
,
compared
to
an
average
of
around
40
%
of
GDP
in
the
OECD
.
16 7
Rather
,
India
's
financial
difficulties
stem
from
a
badly
designed
and
administered
tax
system
.
15 6
Rates
and
rules
for
personal
and
corporate
income
taxes
appear
reasonable
by
international
standards
.
29 13
Nonetheless
,
India
's
government
collects
income
taxes
amounting
to
only
about
3.7
%
of
GDP
,
about
half
that
in
South
Korea
and
the
other
Asian
tigers
.
20 9
Agriculture
in
India
accounts
for
about
a
quarter
of
GDP
,
but
even
wealthy
farmers
do
n't
pay
taxes
.
26 9
Export-oriented
companies
in
the
software
and
other
industries
enjoy
tax
holidays
on
their
profits
,
although
their
employees
do
pay
taxes
on
their
personal
incomes
.
9 5
Despite
reasonable
rates
,
tax
evasion
is
widespread
.
39 23
Cheating
occurs
because
the
government
has
n't
invested
in
personnel
or
in
the
systems
to
detect
tax
evaders
,
who
rarely
face
jail
time
and
can
often
bribe
their
way
out
of
trouble
when
they
do
get
caught
.
31 11
More
subtly
,
the
evasion
of
``
direct
''
taxes
on
incomes
and
profits
reflects
the
mess
in
the
system
of
``
indirect
''
taxes
levied
on
production
and
consumption
.
26 12
Excise
taxes
account
for
over
60
%
of
India
's
indirect
taxes
,
which
in
turn
represent
the
same
proportion
of
its
total
tax
receipts
.
19 13
The
basic
excise
tax
has
been
fixed
at
16
%
of
the
value
of
a
firm
's
output
.
13 7
Then
there
are
a
variety
of
concessions
,
exemptions
,
and
surcharges
.
27 10
For
instance
a
``
concessionary
duty
rate
''
of
8
%
is
levied
on
categories
like
food
products
,
matches
,
cotton
yarn
,
and
computers
.
29 12
An
additional
``
special
excise
duty
''
-LRB-
SED
-RRB-
of
8
%
is
levied
on
products
that
include
polyester
filament
,
cars
,
air
conditioners
and
tires
.
27 12
An
``
additional
excise
duty
''
-LRB-
AED
,
not
to
be
confused
with
the
SED
-RRB-
is
levied
on
``
goods
of
special
importance
.
''
31 12
Exemptions
from
excise
taxes
are
numerous
and
complex
,
including
businesses
with
total
annual
revenues
of
less
than
10
million
rupees
and
firms
located
in
certain
troubled
or
backward
areas
.
27 11
Overall
,
the
exemptions
fall
under
70
broad
categories
,
subdivided
into
259
entries
,
52
conditions
,
and
7
lists
,
each
containing
numerous
items
.
4 5
Exemptions
invite
abuse
.
25 12
For
a
price
,
low
ranking
officials
,
who
have
considerable
discretion
in
applying
the
conditions
,
can
be
persuaded
to
reach
favorable
interpretations
.
29 15
Goods
taxed
at
high
rates
-LRB-
for
example
,
polished
granite
-RRB-
are
sold
as
goods
taxed
at
lower
rates
-LRB-
for
example
,
as
unpolished
granite
-RRB-
.
16 11
Evasion
of
excise
taxes
is
more
contagious
than
evasion
of
taxes
on
profits
and
incomes
.
35 12
If
one
firm
evades
excise
taxes
,
and
the
tax
rate
is
high
compared
to
pre-tax
profit
margins
in
the
industry
,
its
competitors
also
have
to
cheat
,
just
in
order
to
survive
.
19 7
As
evasion
increases
,
governments
levy
``
additional
''
or
``
special
''
duties
,
inciting
further
evasion
.
7 6
Collections
of
direct
taxes
also
suffer
.
45 13
The
bribe
paid
to
the
excise
tax
collector
for
a
favorable
classification
,
the
difference
between
the
value
of
polished
and
unpolished
granite
,
and
the
under-reporting
of
true
revenues
create
``
black
''
funds
,
which
can
not
be
declared
on
income-tax
returns
.
36 16
In
addition
to
impairing
the
state
's
ability
to
provide
basic
public
goods
,
schemes
to
evade
indirect
taxes
also
discourage
businesses
from
adopting
more
productive
technologies
,
which
requires
technologies
that
involve
large-scale
operation
.
28 13
But
,
because
indirect
taxes
are
more
easily
avoided
by
operating
many
small
units
instead
of
one
large
unit
,
economies
of
scale
can
not
be
realized
.
27 16
It
's
worth
noting
that
in
the
software
industry
,
where
all
units
are
exempt
from
indirect
taxes
,
Indian
companies
do
operate
at
efficient
scale
.
23 12
Could
India
emulate
China
's
example
,
where
the
rationalization
of
indirect
taxes
in
1994
set
the
stage
for
a
great
boom
?

Or
are
coalition
governments
in
a
vigorous
democracy
incapable
of
such
reform
?
16 8
Last
year
India
's
BJP-led
government
introduced
legislation
mandating
sharp
reductions
in
the
budget
deficit
.
17 10
It
then
appointed
a
task
force
to
formulate
the
necessary
changes
in
tax
and
spending
policies
.
28 9
This
July
,
the
task
force
proposed
raising
taxes
-LRB-
rather
than
cutting
spending
-RRB-
,
through
,
among
other
things
,
removing
most
indirect
tax
exemptions
.
14 8
India
's
new
Congress-led
government
,
too
,
seems
to
favor
these
proposals
.
39 21
If
Congress
and
the
opposition
parties
follow
through
,
they
will
go
a
long
way
to
sustaining
the
country
's
economic
growth
and
in
dispelling
the
idea
that
democracies
can
not
do
what
's
needed
to
encourage
development
.

What
's
Wrong
With
Turkey
?
49 17
On
December
16
,
Orhan
Pamuk
,
one
of
Turkey
's
most
famous
writers
,
will
enter
an
Istanbul
court
to
face
a
charge
of
``
insulting
the
national
identity
''
after
he
advocated
open
discussion
of
the
Turkish
genocide
of
1.5
million
Armenians
in
1915
and
1916
.
7 7
Pamuk
faces
three
years
in
prison
.
33 14
Turkey
's
effort
to
fine
and
imprison
those
who
do
not
toe
the
official
line
convinces
me
that
I
was
correct
to
oppose
opening
negotiations
on
the
country
's
European
Union
membership
.
30 12
In
December
1999
,
the
European
Council
granted
Turkey
the
status
of
EU
candidate-member
,
implying
that
Turkey
would
accede
to
the
Union
at
some
future
,
unspecified
date
.
41 20
The
Council
subsequently
asked
the
European
Commission
to
decide
by
October
2004
whether
Turkey
had
sufficiently
fulfilled
the
political
criteria
--
including
democracy
,
the
rule
of
law
,
and
respect
for
the
rights
of
ethnic
minorities
--
for
membership
.
21 14
That
decision
was
one
of
the
last
taken
by
Romano
Prodi
's
Commission
,
of
which
I
was
a
member
.
17 12
Of
its
30
members
,
29
said
that
Turkey
had
fulfilled
the
criteria
sufficiently
to
proceed
.
6 5
I
was
the
lone
dissenter
.
26 14
The
Commission
's
own
report
on
Turkey
,
prepared
by
Günter
Verheugen
,
who
was
then
in
charge
of
EU
enlargement
,
shaped
my
decision
.
22 13
This
report
mentioned
that
in
2003
some
21,870
Turks
submitted
asylum
claims
in
the
EU
,
of
which
2,127
were
accepted
.
26 11
In
other
words
,
the
EU
's
own
governments
acknowledged
in
2003
that
the
Turkish
government
had
persecuted
more
than
2,000
of
its
own
citizens
.
34 13
Meanwhile
,
the
Commission
published
a
progress
report
on
Turkey
that
granted
that
reforms
were
continuing
,
albeit
at
a
slower
pace
,
under
Prime
Minister
Recep
Tayyip
Erdogan
's
mildly
Islamic-minded
government
.
51 10
Yet
the
report
also
presented
serious
misgivings
:
human
rights
violations
,
including
torture
,
continued
;
the
military
's
influence
remained
too
high
;
freedom
of
speech
was
not
universally
observed
;
non-Muslim
religious
and
cultural
minorities
faced
discrimination
;
and
violence
against
women
was
not
opposed
strongly
enough
.
11 9
Not
much
has
changed
since
accession
talks
began
this
October
.
11 7
Beyond
the
current
persecution
of
Pamuk
,
unacceptable
behavior
abounds
.
17 10
In
March
2005
,
the
police
violently
disrupted
a
demonstration
to
celebrate
International
Women
's
Day
.
25 14
In
May
,
the
largest
teachers
'
union
was
banned
for
promoting
the
education
of
Turkey
's
14
million
Kurds
in
their
own
language
.
13 9
Indeed
,
intolerance
goes
right
to
the
top
of
the
Turkish
government
.
29 12
Foreign
Minister
Abdullah
Gül
abruptly
cancelled
a
recent
press
conference
in
Copenhagen
when
he
spied
a
Kurdish
journalist
in
the
audience
and
the
Danes
refused
to
evict
him
.
12 7
Such
actions
and
attitudes
amply
justify
my
dissent
of
October
2004
.
27 10
But
,
even
if
these
shortcomings
were
removed
,
Turkey
should
still
not
be
admitted
to
the
EU
,
because
it
is
not
a
European
country
.
32 10
Christianity
,
feudalism
,
the
Renaissance
,
the
Enlightenment
,
democracy
,
and
industrialization
have
made
us
what
we
Europeans
are
,
but
they
have
not
made
Turks
who
they
are
.
22 15
So
I
am
not
convinced
that
reforms
in
Turkey
implemented
at
the
insistence
of
the
European
Commission
would
continue
after
accession
.
10 9
Indeed
,
I
suspect
that
there
will
be
backsliding
.
28 10
Moreover
,
Turkey
's
accession
would
lead
inevitably
to
that
of
Ukraine
,
Belarus
,
and
Moldova
,
and
perhaps
of
Georgia
,
Armenia
,
and
Azerbaïdjan
.
13 7
The
first
three
of
these
countries
are
certainly
more
European
than
Turkey
.
24 11
Leaving
the
three
Caucasian
republics
aside
but
including
the
successor
states
to
Yugoslavia
,
this
would
mean
an
EU
of
some
35
members
.
8 7
What
sort
of
Union
would
that
be
?
10 7
The
EU
is
not
simply
a
club
of
friends
.
17 12
It
is
based
on
freedom
of
movement
of
goods
,
services
,
capital
,
and
people
.
39 14
The
Commission
,
as
the
guardian
of
the
Union
's
treaties
,
must
protect
these
four
fundamental
freedoms
,
which
means
that
it
must
sometimes
persuade
,
and
if
necessary
force
,
member
states
to
change
their
laws
.
28 12
Alcohol
policy
in
Sweden
,
the
Volkswagen-law
in
Germany
,
and
discrimination
against
foreign
investment
funds
in
France
are
examples
of
cases
that
made
the
Commission
unpopular
.
5 5
But
they
were
necessary
.
20 9
By
the
time
I
left
the
Commission
,
I
was
sitting
on
a
pile
of
1,500
such
infringement
proceedings
.
20 15
In
short
,
EU
membership
entails
having
to
accept
incisive
measures
that
deeply
affect
a
state
's
internal
affairs
.
9 8
That
will
be
impossible
with
such
disparate
members
.
17 10
The
EU
would
fall
victim
to
what
the
historian
Paul
Kennedy
calls
``
imperial
overreach
.
''
7 6
The
EU
would
become
unacceptably
diluted
.
47 16
That
is
why
former
French
President
Valéry
Giscard
d'Estaing
feared
that
Turkey
's
entry
would
lead
to
the
EU
's
breakup
,
and
it
is
why
former
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Schmidt
said
,
``
Accession
of
Turkey
would
be
more
than
the
EU
could
bear
.
''
28 11
But
the
strongest
reason
to
oppose
Turkey
's
accession
is
a
question
of
democracy
:
a
majority
of
the
EU
's
population
simply
does
not
want
it
.
20 6
Bolivia
's
Crisis
,
Latin
America
's
Failure
Bolivia
is
not
a
typical
Latin
American
country
by
any
definition
.
33 11
But
for
Haiti
,
it
is
the
poorest
nation
in
the
Western
Hemisphere
,
and
it
is
even
less
stable
,
with
a
history
of
more
than
two
hundred
coups
since
independence
.
39 13
In
a
region
with
a
strong
indigenous
past
but
a
scattered
and
isolated
present
,
Bolivia
is
,
alongside
Guatemala
,
perhaps
the
only
country
in
Latin
America
where
indigenous
peoples
make
up
a
majority
of
the
population
.
24 12
Its
topography
and
ethnic
distribution
are
generating
autonomist
and
even
secessionist
forces
that
threaten
national
unity
in
more
menacing
ways
than
anywhere
else
.
19 7
And
,
of
course
,
it
is
,
with
Paraguay
,
the
only
land-locked
nation
on
the
sub-continent
.
19 13
So
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
to
extrapolate
Bolivia
's
current
crisis
to
the
rest
of
Latin
America
.
36 8
It
is
far
too
simple
to
generalize
:
institutions
elsewhere
are
much
stronger
,
poverty
--
and
particularly
extreme
poverty
--
have
been
diminishing
,
and
the
battle
over
natural
resources
has
been
largely
settled
.
37 9
Even
in
places
like
Venezuela
,
with
both
huge
oil
reserves
and
a
traditional-minded
nationalist
government
,
the
status
quo
allowing
for
foreign
investment
in
energy
resources
has
survived
nearly
eight
years
of
President
Hugo
Chavez
.
39 13
While
the
existence
of
indigenous
movements
is
a
reality
in
many
countries
,
from
Chiapas
to
``
Araucania
,
''
from
Amazonia
to
Ayacucho
,
nowhere
in
Latin
America
have
they
posed
a
genuine
threat
to
national
integrity
.
40 13
So
Bolivia
is
not
a
premonitory
crisis
;
nor
does
the
hoary
old
``
domino
theory
,
''
to
which
both
Lyndon
Johnson
and
Che
Guevara
subscribed
in
the
case
of
Bolivia
,
seem
valid
or
even
half-way
reasonable
.
19 10
Yet
Bolivia
's
current
crisis
does
point
to
the
``
democratic
deficit
''
that
plagues
Latin
America
today
.
17 8
Elected
leaders
have
fallen
for
one
reason
or
another
in
Bolivia
,
Ecuador
,
and
Haiti
.
28 9
Democracy
is
either
defective
or
missing
in
Cuba
,
Mexico
,
and
Nicaragua
,
and
it
is
threatened
by
one
cause
or
another
in
Venezuela
and
Colombia
.
22 9
None
of
these
cases
are
identical
to
the
others
;
they
include
varying
degrees
of
danger
,
harm
,
or
reconciliation
.
28 23
The
question
is
what
can
be
done
about
this
state
of
affairs
,
which
contrasts
starkly
with
the
encouraging
outlook
that
prevailed
just
a
few
years
back
.
34 10
At
the
last
Organization
of
American
States
assembly
in
Fort
Lauderdale
,
Florida
,
the
United
States
delegation
took
a
good
idea
from
others
and
,
by
its
support
,
essentially
sank
it
.
32 12
The
story
began
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
when
former
Argentine
Foreign
Minister
Dante
Caputo
and
the
United
Nations
Development
Program
were
charged
with
drafting
the
Latin
American
Democracy
Report
.
29 15
They
concluded
that
an
early
warning
system
for
democratic
crises
in
the
region
would
help
generate
action
before
matters
got
out
of
control
,
as
in
Bolivia
today
.
26 12
Caputo
and
the
UN
team
then
convinced
Chilean
President
Ricardo
Lagos
to
take
up
the
initiative
and
to
promote
it
with
several
of
his
colleagues
.
12 7
He
did
,
but
the
initiative
did
not
get
very
far
.
17 7
In
fact
,
The
UNDP/Latin
America
Democracy
Report
,
published
in
2004
,
barely
mentioned
it
.
60 21
The
US
and
the
new
Chilean
Secretary
General
of
the
OAS
,
Jose
Miguel
Insulza
,
resurrected
the
plan
during
the
OAS
meeting
in
Florida
,
but
it
was
shot
down
by
Latin
Americans
'
reasonable
fears
that
the
idea
was
directed
against
Venezuela
,
mingled
with
Latin
Americans
'
anachronistic
fears
of
violating
the
sacrosanct
principle
of
non-intervention
.
20 10
Despite
the
continent
's
failure
to
agree
on
the
principle
,
the
idea
of
an
early-warning
system
deserves
attention
.
27 14
Today
there
may
be
little
that
the
hemispheric
community
can
do
about
the
situation
in
Bolivia
,
and
yet
it
is
fraught
with
danger
for
everyone
.
34 11
Evo
Morales
,
the
leader
of
the
opposition
and
of
the
coca-leaf
growers
,
may
be
an
honest
,
if
misguided
,
democratic
leader
,
but
are
his
followers
untainted
by
authoritarian
desires
?
39 16
Hugo
Chavez
may
not
be
financing
Morales
and
Bolivia
's
other
dissidents
,
but
are
Venezuela
and
Cuba
really
not
tempted
to
meddle
in
the
country
where
Che
Guevara
died
leading
a
guerrilla
war
nearly
40
years
ago
?
42 11
Bolivia
's
Santa
Cruz
business
community
may
not
carry
out
its
threat
to
secede
,
but
will
they
prefer
to
share
their
region
's
oil
and
gas
reserves
with
the
indigenous
highland
peoples
rather
than
with
Brazilian
industrialists
from
São
Paulo
?
25 11
Before
events
reached
these
extremes
,
it
might
have
been
a
good
idea
for
the
OAS
-LRB-
not
the
US
-RRB-
to
get
involved
.
37 19
The
region
continues
to
need
that
involvement
--
on
time
,
on
message
,
and
on
a
proper
democratic
platform
,
one
that
is
distinct
from
both
traditional
US
intervention
and
Latin
America
's
traditional
indifference
.
5 5
The
Decline
of
France
?
18 8
The
French
are
notoriously
sensitive
--
if
not
defensive
--
about
France
's
stature
in
the
world
.
37 12
The
French
state
spends
vast
amounts
of
money
to
propagate
the
French
language
and
French
culture
,
yet
the
French
are
painfully
aware
that
the
global
position
of
their
country
is
not
what
it
once
was
.
77 16
No
surprise
,
then
,
that
during
the
last
presidential
election
,
the
publication
of
a
European
Commission
report
claiming
France
's
economic
rank
among
European
countries
had
fallen
from
3
The
OECD
and
Eurostat
,
the
European
body
in
charge
of
such
data
,
thought
they
put
an
end
to
this
aspect
of
the
debate
by
showing
that
France
,
Germany
,
Italy
,
and
Great
Britain
all
enjoy
roughly
equal
per
capita
living
standards
.
9 6
But
the
broader
controversy
would
n't
go
away
.
38 11
Worried
talk
about
``
French
decline
''
reappeared
with
this
year
's
street
protests
against
pension
reform
,
mounting
disputes
over
fiscal
policy
with
the
European
Commission
,
and
bickering
with
America
over
the
war
in
Iraq
.
23 10
Today
's
best-selling
non-fiction
book
in
France
is
a
polemic
by
Nicolas
Baverez
,
La
France
qui
tombe
-LRB-
Falling
France
-RRB-
.
13 9
Baverez
's
book
is
filled
with
quotations
from
de
Gaulle
and
Napoleon
.
29 10
According
to
the
author
,
France
's
last
great
achievements
were
in
the
1970
's
,
when
the
fast
train
,
the
TGV
,
and
Airbus
were
launched
.
22 13
He
castigates
both
Mitterrand
and
Chirac
for
their
``
common
talent
to
win
elections
and
turn
France
into
a
loser
.
''
16 9
The
book
's
success
is
itself
a
sign
of
a
kind
of
``
malaise
.
''
5 6
But
of
which
kind
?
13 7
Baverez
's
evidence
of
degeneration
is
not
as
convincing
as
he
believes
.
21 9
For
example
,
he
cites
the
draining
away
of
industrial
jobs
as
the
most
glaring
evidence
of
France
's
decline
.
9 7
But
deindustrialization
is
common
to
all
advanced
countries
.
45 11
Indeed
,
France
does
actually
better
than
most
of
its
rich
country
rivals
and
,
unlike
Germany
,
the
UK
,
or
the
US
,
has
retained
the
same
global
market
share
in
the
industrial
sector
that
it
had
in
the
early
1970
's
.
18 9
Moreover
,
according
to
a
better
measure
of
comptetitiveness
,
foreign
investment
,
France
does
very
well
.
29 9
According
to
a
recent
report
by
the
Economic
Analysis
Council
,
direct
investment
in
France
grew
to
60
billion
euros
in
2001
,
almost
twice
that
of
Germany
.
24 9
French
cost
competitiveness
also
improved
-LRB-
by
20
%
-RRB-
in
the
last
three
decades
,
with
higher
productivity
offsetting
rapid
wage
growth
.
18 9
But
the
core
of
France
's
long-run
economic
problems
is
precisely
the
fear
of
losing
industrial
jobs
.
32 10
France
remains
a
strong
industrial
power
in
traditional
areas
such
as
automobile
and
aerospace
industries
,
but
it
is
falling
behind
in
innovative
markets
,
where
smaller
companies
spread
new
technologies
.
38 10
France
,
for
instance
,
spends
only
$
30
billion
annually
on
high

France
has
undergone
a
set
of
critically
important
reforms
over
the
past
two
decades
:
economic
and
financial
liberalization
,
elimination
of
price
and
foreign
exchange
controls
,
the
end
of
credit
restrictions
,
European
liberalization
,
reduced
inflation
and
trade
deficits
,
the
advent
of
the
euro
and
the
forced
globalization
of
the
country
's
firms
.
12 12
The
French
malaise
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
them
.
20 15
France
's
problem
is
that
it
fails
to
recognize
the
new
world
of
which
it
already
is
a
part
.
20 15
French
state
capitalism
is
dead
,
and
France
is
finding
it
hard
to
come
to
terms
with
its
passing
.
37 18
Indeed
,
France
must
be
the
only
country
in
which
a
Prime
Minister
,
Lionel
Jospin
,
feels
obliged
to
apologize
the
day
after
for
saying
on
TV
that
``
the
state
is
not
omnipotent
.
''
26 12
There
are
many
reasons
for
this
French
schyzophrenia
,
but
a
critical
one
has
to
do
with
the
political
game
of
the
past
20
years
.
13 8
Until
1981
,
France
had
a
clear
division
between
right
and
left
.
27 11
Since
then
,
both
the
Mitterand
and
Chirac
administrations
blunted
their
ideological
edge
in
order
to
carry
the
difficult
process
of
adjustment
towards
Europe
and
globalization
.
22 10
A
round
of
``
shock
therapy
''
à
la
Mrs.
Thatcher
two
decades
ago
might
have
forged
a
new
political
consciousness
.
20 10
But
the
consensual
dribbling
out
of
reforms
allowed
the
French
to
live
in
one
world
and
think
in
another
.
43 19
This
is
a
key
reason
for
the
political
cataclysm
that
exploded
during
the
last
presidential
campaign
,
when
the
far-right
leader
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
reached
the
second
round
of
the
presidential
election
,
ahead
of
the
incumbent
Prime
Minister
,
Lionel
Jospin
.
26 10
The
rise
of
the
extreme
left
,
which
gathered
10
%
of
the
vote
during
that
presidential
campaign
,
also
attests
to
this
political
failure
.
40 24
France
needs
a
political
revolution
more
than
an
economic
one
if
it
is
to
come
to
terms
with
reality
,
part
of
which
is
that
``
French
decline
''
is
a
fear
of
the
French
people
's
own
making
.
25 13
The
Value
of
European
Values
Europe
's
leaders
have
revived
the
constitutional
talks
that
broke
down
last
December
in
a
dispute
about
voting
rights
.
18 14
Such
disputes
are
,
of
course
,
subject
to
compromises
,
which
are
likely
to
be
found
.
19 13
What
still
needs
to
be
settled
is
a
clear
understanding
of
what
the
constitution
is
meant
to
achieve
.
12 7
Two
fundamental
principles
have
underpinned
European
integration
:
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
.
18 8
Both
principles
lie
at
the
crossroads
of
philosophy
,
politics
,
economics
,
sociology
,
and
law
.
41 17
For
years
they
have
been
present
in
the
legal
and
institutional
framework
of
the
European
Union
-
in
treaties
,
in
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Rights
-LRB-
which
quotes
them
in
the
Preamble
-RRB-
,
in
the
recent
draft
Constitution
.
15 8
They
are
,
in
short
,
inscribed
in
the
EU
's
history
and
ideals
.
9 5
But
what
do
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
really
mean
?
44 14
Consider
solidarity
,
which
is
open
to
at
least
two
interpretations
:
static
solidarity
,
which
concerns
only
the
distribution
of
income
and
wealth
,
and
the
broader
concept
of
dynamic
solidarity
,
which
concerns
the
production
of
income
and
wealth
as
well
.
46 11
In
the
postwar
history
of
European
integration
,
dynamic
solidarity
was
strong
in
the
first
period
-
that
of
the
European
Coal
and
Steel
Community
-
both
in
its
economic
development
strategy
-LRB-
reconstruction
-RRB-
and
in
the
Treaties
,
particularly
the
Treaty
of
Rome
.
24 11
This
does
not
mean
that
dynamic
solidarity
was
subsequently
suppressed
:
European
Monetary
Union
,
for
example
,
is
an
expression
of
it
.
19 9
Some
countries
did
not
immediately
benefit
from
the
euro
,
but
accepted
it
for
the
sake
of
solidarity
.
14 12
They
were
convinced
that
it
would
have
positive
effects
in
the
long
run
.
22 9
Dynamic
solidarity
,
in
other
words
,
means
favoring
policies
that
foster
investment
,
innovation
,
economic
growth
,
and
employment
.
20 8
However
,
as
GDP
growth
in
the
EU
indicates
,
dynamic
solidarity
has
been
undermined
over
the
last
decade
.
11 7
What
is
particularly
worrying
is
the
research
and
development
lag
.
49 16
Realization
of
the
EU
's
so-called
Lisbon
strategy
,
adopted
in
2000
with
the
promise
of
creating
the
world
's
most
competitive
economy
,
is
threatened
by
a
growing
emphasis
on
static
solidarity
,
reflected
in
high
social
welfare
costs
and
the
high
taxes
needed
to
finance
them
.
26 13
The
primacy
of
static
solidarity
is
due
to
an
aging
population
,
which
,
along
with
slower
growth
,
has
led
to
structural
fiscal
imbalances
.
30 15
One
of
the
biggest
challenges
for
the
future
of
the
EU
is
addressing
today
's
prevalence
of
static
solidarity
oriented
towards
old
people
over
dynamic
solidarity
favoring
young
people
.
25 21
After
all
,
the
Union
can
not
afford
to
permit
current
consumption
to
continue
to
prevail
over
the
investment
needed
to
ensure
future
prosperity
.
24 13
Subsidiarity
is
similar
to
the
concept
of
solidarity
in
that
it
,
too
,
has
two
interpretations
:
vertical
subsidiarity
and
horizontal
subsidiarity
.
26 11
Vertical
subsidiarity
concerns
the
distribution
of
powers
among
different
levels
of
government
and
sovereignty
:
the
EU
,
national
states
,
regions
,
and
municipalities
.
9 6
The
best-known
application
of
this
principle
is
federalism
.
14 7
In
the
European
Treaties
,
we
find
a
clear
expression
of
vertical
subsidiarity
.
16 10
But
is
this
enough
to
encompass
the
emerging
institutional
and
constitutional
settings
of
the
Union
?
19 9
Horizontal
subsidiarity
concerns
the
responsibility
and
freedom
of
human
beings
,
as
well
as
social
and
economic
powers
.
12 8
It
encompasses
the
relations
between
state
,
society
,
and
market
.
19 12
But
society
and
the
market
have
their
own
rights
and
sovereignties
that
are
not
granted
by
the
state
.
12 10
So
the
problem
comes
in
assuring
the
autonomy
of
each
realm
.
34 14
An
example
of
horizontal
subsidiarity
is
the
internal
European
market
,
which
created
a
new
kind
of
economic
freedom
and
increased
competition
between
firms
because
they
are
no
longer
protected
by
national
governments
.
32 16
Horizontal
subsidiarity
means
that
in
both
society
and
the
economic
sphere
,
the
state
can
not
violate
individual
freedom
and
responsibility
,
which
must
be
respected
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
.
31 22
It
also
means
that
support
must
be
given
by
a
``
superior
power
''
whenever
individual
freedom
and
responsibility
do
not
suffice
to
achieve
the
ends
necessary
for
human
dignity
.
25 12
This
support
,
however
,
should
be
implemented
in
ways
that
the
natural
potential
of
individuals
,
society
,
and
the
market
is
promoted
.
39 14
But
that
is
possible
only
when
the
role
of
horizontal
subsidiarity
is
clearly
formulated
,
which
it
has
not
been
in
the
European
Treaties
,
the
Charter
of
Fundamental
Rights
,
or
the
work
of
the
European
Convention
.
59 23
In
short
,
solidarity
has
come
to
mean
redistribution
rather
than
growth
-LRB-
which
is
how
today
's
generation
expresses
solidarity
with
respect
to
future
generations
-RRB-
,
while
subsidiarity
has
come
to
mean
the
distribution
of
political
power
,
rather
than
a
careful
delineation
of
the
boundaries
between
the
state
,
civil
society
,
and
the
market
.
13 11
Today
,
both
values
are
defined
in
ways
that
favor
the
state
.
17 10
Indeed
,
focusing
on
market-based
growth
has
often
been
identified
with
the
semi-alien
values
of
America
.
16 8
But
these
values
are
deeply
ingrained
in
Europe
,
and
should
be
brought
out
again
.
36 18
The
EU
should
restore
its
economic
vitality
by
pursuing
a
model
of
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
that
is
more
balanced
in
favor
of
the
market
and
society
,
and
that
reduces
the
state
's
socio-economic
influence
.
57 15
State
institutions
should
deliver
public
goods
-LRB-
like
defense
,
justice
,
and
fiscal
and
monetary
policy
-RRB-
,
society
should
deliver
social
goods
-LRB-
like
culture
,
education
,
and
assistance
to
needy
people
-RRB-
,
and
the
market
should
deliver
economic
goods
-LRB-
which
are
connected
with
profits
,
growth
,
and
employment
-RRB-
.
49 17
In
the
21st
century
,
Europe
must
reconsider
the
value
of
both
principles
-
solidarity
and
subsidiarity
-
if
it
is
to
attain
integration
's
historic
goal
:
the
freedom
and
well
being
needed
to
overcome
the
differences
and
political
divisions
that
incited
tragedy
in
the
20th
century
.
13 10
That
is
the
spirit
in
which
the
European
Constitution
must
be
written
.
15 9
The
Politics
of
Values
The
debate
about
the
American
elections
has
still
not
abated
.
35 15
How
did
President
George
W.
Bush
manage
to
get
three
million
votes
more
than
Senator
John
Kerry
,
and
,
in
addition
,
to
have
a
Republican
majority
elected
in
both
houses
of
Congress
?
17 8
There
is
not
much
agreement
on
the
answers
,
but
two
themes
recur
in
many
explanations
.
4 5
One
is
personality
.
25 16
At
a
time
of
uncertainty
and
threat
,
people
had
more
confidence
in
the
president
they
knew
than
in
the
candidate
who
seemed
unproven
.
6 5
The
second
theme
is
values
.
13 9
People
voted
for
a
set
of
values
rather
than
for
specific
policies
.
33 9
Indeed
,
some
-LRB-
it
is
said
-RRB-
agreed
with
Kerry
's
policies
but
nevertheless
gave
their
vote
to
Bush
,
because
they
felt
``
at
ease
''
with
his
general
attitudes
.
13 7
Clearly
,
the
United
States
is
now
deeply
divided
in
electoral
terms
.
31 8
An
arch
of
blue
-LRB-
Democratic
-RRB-
states
in
the
East
,
North
,
and
West
spans
a
huge
red
-LRB-
Republican
-RRB-
area
in
the
middle
and
the
South
.
13 7
More
than
that
,
the
divisions
are
reproduced
at
the
local
level
.
19 10
Gerrymandering
--
the
drawing
of
electoral
boundaries
to
benefit
a
particular
political
party
--
is
no
longer
necessary
.
22 15
People
actually
tend
to
move
to
areas
in
which
a
majority
of
others
share
their
values
,
whether
Republican
or
Democratic
.
6 5
What
exactly
are
these
values
?
20 8
They
have
to
do
,
or
so
we
hear
,
with
``
god
,
guns
,
and
gays
.
''
24 16
Religion
plays
a
part
in
them
,
including
the
literal
truth
of
the
bible
when
it
comes
to
the
story
of
the
creation
.
21 8
The
possession
of
a
gun
is
the
ultimate
test
of
individualism
,
and
using
guns
in
wars
is
not
abhorrent
.
12 7
Gays
and
other
``
modern
''
practices
are
rejected
as
self-indulgent
.
35 16
As
the
political
scientist
Andrew
Hacker
recently
put
it
,
``
the
Bush
candidacy
was
framed
to
make
a
majority
by
giving
some
60
million
people
a
chance
to
feel
good
about
themselves
.
''
14 6
Is
all
this
an
American
phenomenon
,
or
are
there
similar
trends
elsewhere
?
27 10
One
answer
is
that
as
an
American
phenomenon
,
the
politics
of
values
may
command
a
majority
now
,
but
it
is
by
no
means
general
.
11 7
Europe
and
other
parts
of
the
world
are
equally
divided
.
25 18
Personality
undoubtedly
matters
,
and
beneath
overt
political
differences
there
may
also
be
issues
of
values
that
have
not
yet
come
to
the
fore
.
17 9
But
traditional
political
differences
based
on
disagreement
over
fundamental
values
play
a
diminishing
part
in
elections
.
37 11
For
example
,
Prime
Minister
Tony
Blair
,
the
next
major
leader
to
face
an
election
,
plays
the
personality
card
and
talks
about
policies
,
but
he
represents
above
all
a
set
of
middle-class
values
.
33 10
When
he
speaks
of
``
modernization
,
''
or
of
``
bringing
things
into
the
twenty-first
century
,
''
he
manages
to
suggest
a
strange
but
appealing
mixture
of
change
and
stability
.
11 7
This
has
left
the
Conservative
opposition
without
an
effective
response
.
28 12
Even
questions
like
tax
cuts
and
stricter
asylum
rules
do
not
quite
hit
the
value
chords
that
the
Republican
Party
in
the
US
has
managed
to
touch
.
18 12
The
picture
is
similar
in
Germany
,
where
the
overt
influence
of
value
politics
is
even
smaller
.
10 6
The
German
debate
is
still
largely
a
policy
debate
.
29 9
When
the
opposition
offers
the
government
talks
on
health-care
reform
or
,
most
recently
,
on
combating
unemployment
,
the
underlying
competition
is
about
competence
rather
than
values
.
22 10
Yet
underneath
the
common
battlegrounds
of
political
debate
in
Britain
and
Germany
and
elsewhere
in
Europe
,
value
clashes
are
lurking
.
32 17
Parties
fight
for
those
who
can
be
made
``
to
feel
good
about
themselves
,
''
but
they
may
not
fully
realize
that
this
is
only
partly
a
matter
of
policy
.
31 13
Religion
is
not
likely
to
become
a
major
factor
in
European
politics
;
opinion
polls
show
that
religious
observance
marks
one
of
the
few
major
differences
between
Americans
and
Europeans
.
22 9
Guns
also
have
a
different
place
in
the
European
mind
;
it
is
their
absence
that
most
Europeans
regard
as
important
.
11 7
A
pacifist
streak
of
values
is
also
unmistakable
in
Europe
.
21 8
But
the
issue
of
political
correctness
-LRB-
``
gays
''
-RRB-
plays
a
so-far
underrated
part
in
Europe
as
well
.
21 9
Most
importantly
,
the
Europe
itself
divides
Europeans
,
as
the
``
national
question
''
arises
in
each
European
state
.
11 10
It
is
an
issue
of
values
,
inspired
by
fear
.
29 11
People
want
to
know
where
they
belong
,
and
in
the
process
they
turn
against
the
US
and
toward
Europe
,
or
against
Europe
and
toward
their
country
.
25 9
Either
way
,
we
leave
the
realms
of
policies
,
and
even
of
politics
,
and
enter
the
murky
domain
of
symbols
and
myth
.
25 9
This
,
at
any
rate
,
is
the
main
risk
that
democratic
countries
face
,
for
the
politics
of
values
is
a
dangerous
development
.
18 14
It
reintroduces
fundamental
divisions
in
societies
whose
greatest
democratic
achievement
was
precisely
to
banish
fundamentalism
from
politics
.
16 13
Enlightened
public
debate
must
be
a
dispute
about
policies
contained
by
a
community
of
values
.
14 9
Insisting
on
this
is
therefore
a
primary
objective
of
the
politics
of
freedom
.
43 10
The
Coming
Age
of
Interest
One
swallow
does
not
make
a
summer
,
and
one
month
of
normal
job
growth
,
and
rising
prices
in
the
United
States
does
not
mean
that
the
Federal
Reserve
no
longer
fears
economic
malaise
and
deflation
.
25 17
But
the
time
will
come
when
world
interest
rates
begin
to
rise
,
as
central
bankers
prepare
to
resist
the
upward
creep
of
inflation
.
48 16
Whenever
that
moment
arrives
-
whether
this
fall
,
in
2005
or
2006
,
or
in
2007
-
America
and
the
global
economy
will
face
financial
vulnerabilities
that
reflect
the
success
of
the
past
three
years
of
monetary
stimulation
in
stemming
declines
in
production
and
moderating
unemployment
.
27 8
Short-term
interest
rates
are
astonishingly
low
:
only
2
%
in
the
euro
zone
,
just
1
%
in
the
US
,
and
zero
in
Japan
.
35 16
Expansionary
monetary
policy
has
been
successful
,
but
only
by
pushing
interest
rates
to
historic
lows
-
and
by
convincing
investors
that
borrowing
costs
will
remain
at
their
current
levels
for
a
long
time
.
52 12
The
main
result
of
monetary
stimulus
has
been
to
boost
asset
prices
:
anything
that
pays
a
yield
,
a
dividend
,
or
a
rent
becomes
much
more
attractive
-
and
hence
much
more
valuable
in
money
terms
-
when
interest
rates
are
very
low
and
expected
to
stay
very
low
.
41 13
This
explains
the
large
gaps
between
current
prices
for
real
estate
in
the
US
,
equities
in
New
York
,
London
,
and
Frankfurt
,
and
long-term
bonds
everywhere
and
what
one
would
conventionally
think
their
fundamental
values
should
be
.
12 12
So
what
will
happen
when
central
banks
start
raising
interest
rates
?
33 14
In
1994
,
rising
short-term
rates
caused
increases
in
long-term
rates
-
and
declines
in
long-term
bond
prices
-
that
were
at
least
double
what
standard
models
at
the
time
were
predicting
.
23 8
Moreover
,
interest
rates
in
the
world
's
peripheral
,
developing
economies
rose
far
more
than
rates
in
the
advanced
industrial
core
.
30 10
Thus
,
the
first
danger
to
worry
about
for
2005
and
beyond
-
when
world
interest
rates
will
most
likely
rise
-
is
another
wave
of
emerging-market
financial
crises
.
54 16
For
countries
like
Mexico
,
Brazil
,
Turkey
,
Argentina
,
Korea
,
Malaysia
,
and
Thailand
,
the
record
of
the
1990
's
demonstrates
that
interest-rate
spreads
can
widen
and
capital
flows
reverse
remarkably
rapidly
,
regardless
of
how
favorably
IMF
officials
and
analyses
by
major
banks
view
a
country
's
policies
.
8 5
Emerging-market
interest-rate
spreads
now
are
abnormally
low
.
39 17
International
money
flows
-
aside
from
inflows
into
the
US
-
are
not
yet
at
levels
associated
with
``
irrational
exuberance
,
''
but
there
is
still
time
for
that
to
happen
before
interest
rates
start
to
rise
.
30 14
This
is
an
alarming
prospect
,
because
if
there
is
one
lesson
from
the
1990
's
,
it
is
that
nobody
should
overestimate
the
stability
of
international
financial
flows
.
14 6
The
second
danger
springs
from
high
asset
values
within
the
advanced
industrial
core
.
50 17
The
dominant
mode
of
thought
within
the
Federal
Reserve
-
with
which
I
agree
-
appears
to
be
that
the
information-technology
revolution
is
continuing
,
that
the
pace
of
growth
of
potential
output
in
the
US
remains
very
fast
,
and
that
the
output
gap
is
thus
relatively
wide
.
20 14
This
implies
that
interest
rates
may
,
in
fact
,
need
to
stay
low
for
a
very
considerable
period
.
29 9
Moreover
,
confidence
in
the
Federal
Reserve
is
high
,
and
the
last
remnants
of
the
1970
's
inflation
risk
premium
have
been
wrung
out
of
interest
rates
.
30 10
As
a
result
,
even
after
output
levels
return
to
their
potential
,
interest
rates
will
stay
low
by
the
standards
of
the
1980
's
and
the
1990
's
.
25 13
All
of
this
is
,
of
course
,
good
news
for
those
who
own
assets
like
long-term
bonds
,
stocks
,
and
real
estate
.
33 16
Indeed
,
elevating
long-term
asset
prices
was
precisely
the
point
of
lowering
interest
rates
:
making
bondholders
and
especially
real
estate
owners
richer
,
after
all
,
provides
a
fillip
to
spending
.
27 15
But
the
bad
news
is
that
even
if
interest
rates
are
expected
to
remain
low
for
a
while
,
they
will
not
stay
this
low
indefinitely
.
15 9
The
bottom
line
is
that
when
interest
rates
rise
,
asset
values
will
fall
.
38 16
It
is
during
such
periods
-
particularly
when
asset
values
fall
swiftly
and
substantially
-
that
we
discover
exactly
how
good
our
central
bankers
are
at
their
main
job
:
reducing
financial
volatility
and
promoting
economic
stability
.
51 22
It
is
also
during
such
periods
that
we
discover
how
many
people
who
are
holding
long-term
bonds
,
real
estate
,
or
stocks
are
doing
so
not
because
they
think
current
prices
are
attractive
relative
to
fundamentals
,
but
because
their
prices
have
gone
up
over
the
past
several
years
.
39 20
This
is
a
crucial
question
for
policy
makers
,
because
those
who
bought
long-term
assets
due
to
what
seemed
like
perpetually
rising
prices
are
also
those
who
will
sell
as
soon
as
price
trends
seem
to
be
reversing
.
21 8
In
particular
,
the
US
trade
deficit
looms
as
a
massive
source
of
instability
should
long-term
asset
prices
fall
significantly
.
35 13
To
be
sure
,
the
challenges
facing
the
world
's
economic
policy
makers
during
the
next
several
years
will
be
different
from
those
that
they
have
faced
since
the
collapse
of
the
NASDAQ
bubble
.
21 13
The
risks
associated
with
inflation
are
probably
less
dangerous
than
those
generated
by
collapsing
output
and
the
threat
of
deflation
.
24 12
But
,
as
we
learned
in
the
1990
's
,
this
does
not
mean
that
the
coming
challenges
will
be
easier
to
handle
.
39 11
America
's
Opposing
Futures
I
recently
learned
something
interesting
:
American
international
finance
economists
and
American
domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
have
very
different
--
indeed
,
opposing
--
views
of
the
likely
consequences
of
America
's
huge
current-account
deficit
.
23 10
International
finance
economists
see
a
financial
crisis
as
likely
,
followed
by
a
painful
and
perhaps
prolonged
recession
in
the
United
States
.
30 11
Domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
,
by
contrast
,
see
a
forthcoming
fall
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
not
as
a
crisis
,
but
as
an
opportunity
to
accelerate
growth
.
41 15
Domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
look
at
the
situation
roughly
like
this
:
at
some
point
in
the
future
,
foreign
central
banks
will
become
less
willing
to
continue
buying
massive
amounts
of
dollar-denominated
securities
in
order
to
prop
up
the
greenback
.
22 7
When
they
cease
their
large-scale
dollar-purchase
programs
,
the
value
of
the
dollar
will
fall
--
and
it
will
fall
hard
.
37 11
But
,
according
to
this
view
,
as
the
dollar
's
value
declines
,
US
exports
will
become
more
attractive
to
foreigners
and
American
employment
will
rise
,
with
labor
re-allocated
to
the
newly-vibrant
export
sector
.
57 23
It
will
be
like
what
happened
in
Britain
after
it
abandoned
its
exchange-rate
peg
and
allowed
the
pound
to
depreciate
relative
to
the
Deutschmark
,
or
what
happened
in
the
US
in
the
late
1980
's
,
when
the
dollar
depreciated
against
the
pound
,
the
Deutschmark
,
and
--
most
importantly
--
the
Japanese
yen
.
9 6
International
finance
economists
see
a
far
bleaker
future
.
48 17
They
see
the
end
of
large-scale
dollar-purchase
programs
by
central
banks
leading
not
only
to
a
decline
in
the
dollar
,
but
also
to
a
spike
in
US
long-term
interest
rates
,
which
will
curb
consumption
spending
immediately
and
throttle
investment
spending
after
only
a
short
lag
.
46 14
To
be
sure
,
international
finance
economists
also
see
US
exports
benefiting
as
the
value
of
the
dollar
declines
,
but
the
lags
in
demand
are
such
that
the
export
boost
will
come
a
year
or
two
after
the
decline
in
consumption
and
investment
spending
.
27 14
Eight
to
ten
million
people
will
have
to
shift
employment
from
services
and
construction
into
exports
and
import-competing
goods
,
implying
that
structural
unemployment
will
rise
.
33 11
Moreover
,
there
may
be
a
financial
panic
:
large
financial
institutions
with
short-term
liabilities
and
long-term
assets
will
have
a
difficult
time
weathering
a
large
rise
in
long-term
dollar-denominated
interest
rates
.
43 14
This
mismatch
can
cause
financial
stress
and
bankruptcy
just
as
easily
as
banks
'
local-currency
assets
and
dollar
liabilities
caused
stress
and
bankruptcy
in
the
Mexican
and
East
Asian
crises
of
the
1990
's
and
in
the
Argentinean
crisis
of
this
decade
.
23 11
When
international
finance
economists
sketch
this
scenario
,
domestically
oriented
macroeconomists
respond
that
it
sounds
like
a
case
of
incompetent
monetary
policy
.
22 13
Why
should
the
Federal
Reserve
allow
long-term
interest
rates
to
spike
just
because
other
central
banks
have
ceased
their
dollar-purchase
programs
?
32 12
Should
not
the
Fed
step
in
and
replace
them
with
its
own
purchases
of
long-term
US
Treasury
bonds
,
thereby
keeping
long-term
interest
rates
at
a
level
conducive
to
full
employment
?
19 13
To
this
,
international
finance
economists
respond
that
the
Fed
does
not
have
the
power
to
do
so
.
42 15
When
forced
to
choose
between
full
employment
and
price
stability
,
the
international
finance
economists
say
that
the
Fed
will
choose
price
stability
,
because
its
institutional
memory
of
the
1970
's
,
when
inflation
ran
rampant
,
remains
very
strong
.
51 10
Therefore
,
since
a
fall
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
raises
import
prices
,
and
thus
functions
as
a
negative
shock
to
the
supply
side
of
the
economy
,
the
Fed
will
have
to
raise
,
not
lower
,
interest
rates
,
and
sell
,
not
buy
,
bonds
.
18 10
Serious
economists
whom
I
respect
enormously
find
themselves
taking
strong
positions
on
opposite
sides
of
this
debate
.
23 13
I
'm
not
wise
enough
to
say
which
side
is
right
,
but
I
certainly
know
which
side
I
hope
is
wrong
.
20 9
Europe
's
Free
Riders
In
the
United
States
,
individual
states
that
follow
unsound
fiscal
policies
face
a
penalty
.
14 11
Their
bonds
sell
at
a
discount
relative
to
those
of
better-managed
individual
states
.
28 14
The
higher
debt
service
they
must
pay
serves
--
to
some
degree
--
as
a
form
of
discipline
against
the
temptation
to
spend
now
and
pay
later
.
34 10
Of
course
,
the
discipline
of
the
market
is
not
perfect
:
the
bond
market
does
not
``
see
''
implicit
future
liabilities
-LRB-
like
promised
pension
payments
-RRB-
to
any
great
degree
.
35 12
Nevertheless
,
this
enforced
fiscal
discipline
,
combined
with
individual
states
'
own
internal
budgetary
procedures
,
has
prevented
a
large
scale
state-level
fiscal
crisis
from
occurring
in
the
US
since
the
Great
Depression
.
7 7
Let
us
now
turn
to
Europe
.
26 13
Before
the
advent
of
the
euro
,
there
were
many
fiscal
crises
in
individual
nation-states
in
southern
Europe
,
which
produced
waves
of
high
inflation
.
37 11
But
,
with
the
single
currency
in
place
,
the
road
to
solving
a
fiscal
crisis
through
inflation
has
been
closed
,
as
the
European
Central
Bank
-LRB-
ECB
-RRB-
now
stands
watch
over
monetary
policy
.
55 17
Nevertheless
,
even
with
nation-states
no
longer
able
to
rely
on
inflation
to
solve
their
unbalanced
finances
,
the
single
currency
allows
them
to
use
the
debt
capacity
properly
belonging
to
other
members
of
the
European
Union
to
extend
their
spending
sprees
and
postpone
political
accountability
for
periods
of
laissez
les
bons
temps
roulés
.
27 11
To
head
off
this
possibility
,
the
EU
created
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
:
government
deficits
had
to
be
less
than
3
%
of
GDP
.
41 9
Last
week
,
the
government
of
Germany
--
once
the
most
fiscally
prudent
and
disciplined
EU
country
--
broke
the
pact
's
rules
for
fiscal
discipline
for
the
fifth
consecutive
year
,
and
did
so
without
-LRB-
much
-RRB-
apology
.
37 13
Finance
Minister
Peer
Steinbrueck
signaled
that
he
expected
the
European
Commission
to
apply
some
sanctions
to
Germany
:
the
credibility
of
the
pact
would
,
he
said
,
be
at
stake
if
no
action
were
taken
.
20 11
Thus
,
Germany
would
not
block
sanctions
this
time
,
as
it
did
two
and
a
half
years
ago
.
41 19
But
Steinbrueck
also
made
it
clear
that
he
expects
any
sanctions
in
response
to
Germany
's
predicted
3.4
%
-
of-GDP
fiscal
deficit
to
be
largely
symbolic
,
not
penalties
that
would
cost
its
government
or
economy
anything
of
significance
.
24 15
The
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
is
not
--
or
is
not
yet
--
working
anywhere
near
the
way
it
was
intended
to
work
.
5 5
What
about
market
discipline
?
31 20
Is
the
German
government
's
willingness
to
issue
more
debt
and
run
bigger
deficits
limited
because
the
market
recognizes
and
penalizes
nation
states
that
allow
their
fiscal
positions
to
weaken
?
6 5
In
a
word
,
no
.
18 8
The
interest
rates
on
the
euro-denominated
sovereign
debt
of
the
twelve
euro-zone
governments
are
all
very
similar
.
34 23
So
the
market
does
not
seem
to
care
that
countries
have
different
potentials
to
generate
exports
to
fund
the
financial
flows
needed
for
debt
repayments
,
or
different
current
and
projected
debt-to-GDP
ratios
.
49 20
Willem
Buiter
of
the
University
of
Amsterdam
and
Anne
Sibert
of
the
University
of
London
believe
that
it
is
the
ECB
's
willingness
to
,
in
effect
,
accept
all
euro-zone
debt
as
collateral
that
has
undermined
the
market
's
willingness
to
be
an
enforcer
of
fiscal
prudence
.
54 17
As
long
as
the
marginal
piece
of
German
debt
is
used
as
collateral
for
a
short-term
loan
or
as
the
centerpiece
of
a
repurchase
agreement
to
gain
liquidity
,
its
value
is
much
more
likely
to
be
determined
by
the
terms
on
which
the
ECB
accepts
it
as
collateral
than
by
its
fundamentals
.
26 10
The
ECB
's
treatment
of
all
such
debt
as
equally
powerful
sources
of
back-up
liquidity
now
trumps
any
analysis
of
differences
in
long-term
sovereign
risk
.
9 5
In
the
long
run
,
this
is
dangerous
.
19 11
Both
market
discipline
and
sound
fiscal
management
are
needed
to
create
a
reasonable
chance
of
long-run
price
stability
.
47 18
Omit
either
a
market
penalty
now
for
behavior
that
may
become
reckless
or
the
institutional
levers
that
give
a
voice
to
future
generations
,
and
you
run
grave
risks
--
perhaps
not
today
or
tomorrow
,
but
someday
,
and
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
26 12
As
time
passes
,
the
coming
of
the
single
currency
and
the
way
that
the
euro
has
been
implemented
is
generating
more
and
more
unease
.
13 8
Policy
as
a
whole
over
the
entire
euro
zone
is
too
deflationary
.
29 19
The
necessary
transfers
are
not
being
made
to
make
the
common
currency
bearable
to
regions
that
lose
out
and
are
already
in
recession
when
the
ECB
tightens
