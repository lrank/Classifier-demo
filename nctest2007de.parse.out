Europe
divided
along
racial
House
A
common
feature
of
all
the
extreme
right
in
Europe
is
their
racism
and
the
fact
that
they
use
the
immigration
issue
as
a
political
lever
.
54 13
The
Lega
Nord
in
Italy
,
the
Vlaams
Block
in
the
Netherlands
,
the
followers
of
Le
Pen
's
National
Front
in
France
,
are
examples
of
political
parties
or
movements
,
which
are
a
common
theme
:
have
made
rejection
of
immigration
and
to
call
for
a
simplified
policy
to
regulate
them
.
35 11
While
individuals
such
as
JÃ¶rg
Haider
and
Jean-Marie
Le
Pen
come
and
-LRB-
unfortunately
not
too
soon
-RRB-
like
to
go
again
,
the
race
question
from
the
European
policy
will
not
soon
disappear
.
17 7
An
aging
native
population
and
increasingly
open
borders
increase
the
racial
fragmentation
in
the
European
countries
.
34 12
The
major
parties
of
the
right
and
the
center-left
have
the
problem
found
,
where
they
have
the
head
buried
in
the
sand
and
hoping
all
views
contrary
,
it
may
soon
disappear
.
14 11
but
That
is
not
how
the
history
of
racism
in
America
clearly
shows
.
23 7
The
relations
between
the
races
were
in
the
U.S.
for
decades
-
and
do
it
today
-
the
center
of
political
debate
.
27 12
This
went
so
far
that
racial
segregation
was
just
as
important
as
the
income
-
if
not
more
important
-
to
determine
political
sympathies
and
attitudes
.
28 12
The
first
step
to
deal
with
the
race
question
is
to
understand
the
cause
and
consequences
of
racial
hostilities
,
even
if
it
means
uncover
unpleasant
facts
.
22 10
Just
did
a
large
number
of
research
projects
in
economics
,
sociology
,
psychology
and
political
science
in
the
United
States
.
14 9
This
research
showed
that
people
of
different
races
rely
much
less
each
other
.
18 16
The
whites
are
less
willing
to
support
social
spending
because
they
believe
in
order
to
favor
minorities
.
26 10
More
racially
divided
societies
have
less
capable
governments
,
more
corruption
and
nepotism
,
more
crime
and
less
public
benefits
per
dollar
of
tax
revenue
.
19 15
This
does
not
mean
the
answer
would
be
to
eliminate
the
differences
and
to
create
racially
similar
communities
.
24 16
But
we
must
recognize
the
realities
behind
this
question
in
order
to
design
a
robust
public
policy
in
terms
of
race
relations
can

course
,
there
is
no
consensus
among
Americans
about
how
it
was
done
.
21 12
Some
affirmative
action
programs
to
favor
minorities
in
the
allocation
of
jobs
,
access
to
the
colleges
and
public
contracts
.
14 9
These
measures
are
considered
as
a
kind
of
reparation
for
past
injustice
done
.
18 10
You
should
,
more
importantly
,
help
shape
role
models
to
overcome
remaining
and
perhaps
involuntary
discrimination
.
49 20
those
who
are
against
such
an
action
,
claiming
that
it
would
take
only
one
shows
no
respect
to
racial
differences
policy
in
conjunction
with
a
free
market
and
family-friendly
values
to
provide
for
the
minorities
jobs
and
to
help
the
families
of
the
colored
people
stay
together
.
8 7
The
latter
is
crucial
for
any
policy
.
28 11
Because
one
of
the
main
causes
of
poverty
in
the
U.S.
is
the
large
spread
of
households
with
single
parents
-LRB-
ie
mothers
-RRB-
among
the
colored
.
26 17
Regardless
of
the
correct
answer
is
in
the
question
of
how
to
deal
with
the
races
to
be
an
important
task
in
the
U.S.
policy

25 17
Nevertheless
company
you
can
be
sure
that
right-wing
politicians
in
America
continue
to
rely
on
the
,
race
card
``
as
a
tactical

``
Death

How

and

and

''
But
for
every
book
like
this
,
there
are
ten
others
with
a.
serious
analysis
of
the
question
of
race
in
America
.
15 9
Policy
analysis
and
debate
on
race
relations
are
lagging
terribly
in
Europe
behind
her
.
43 14
Mostly
,
the
issue
is
also
too
tight
,
treated
with
respect
to
rates
of
immigration
and
border
regulations
that
limit
this
and
not
in
terms
of
the
associated
social
problems
and
the
opportunities
that
arise
from
an
increasingly
racially
mixed
Europe
.
15 11
course
a
clear
immigration
policy
is
necessary
to
avoid
the
accumulation
of
illegal
immigrants
.
7 6
But
that
can
not
be
all
.
21 15
Controls
at
the
border
with
Mexico
are
not
all
that
has
to
say
American
politics
about
race
in
the
country
.
36 14
Europe
is
rich
and
aging
rapidly
,
and
the
Europeans
are
cushioned
by
generous
welfare
programs
no
longer

``

or
in

industry

take

7 5
already
makes
an
increased
immigration
inevitable
.
30 9
The
Europeans
,
however
,
are
quick
to
the
United
States
any
error
in
its
minority
policy
and
any
sign
of
racism
across
the
Atlantic
to
accuse
of
time
.
45 11
When
reading
the
European
press
one
takes
into
racial
issues
often
have
a
superiority
complex
towards
the
United
States
that
:
The
Americans
have
problems
with
racism
,
whereas
we
are
immune
,
apart
from
a
few
crazed
neo-Nazis
,
skinheads
and
the
like
.
57 17
In
recent
weeks
,
it
has
been
shown
that
the
race
problem
in
Europe
from
Paris
to
Amsterdam
is
located
much
deeper
and
-
as
in
the
U.S.
-
going
back
to
the
sad
fact
that
race
relations
are
inherently
difficult
and
that
a
trusting
and
cooperative
approach
does
not
easily
cross
racial
barriers
gets
over
.
50 16
If
Europe
's
major
parties
do
not
begin
to
examine
the
racial
tensions
in
Europe
seriously
and
to
understand
and
,
to
make
race
``
one
of
its
key
priorities
,
individuals
will
see
how
Le
Pen
himself
obliged
to
fill
in
the
gaps
with
their
message
of
hate

Yet
the
result
of
some
banter
Gaul
with
the
European
Commission
is
expected
to
decide
the
fate
of
the
new
and
enlarged
Europe
hardly
less
severe
.
38 16
France
has
decided
unilaterally
,
the
Stability
and
Growth
Pact
to
ignore
by
,
took
a
predicted
deficit
,
which
is
well
above

threshold
of

28 11
The
French
chat
to
the
rational
rigor
of
their
thinking
to
good
,
but
when
it
comes
to
budget
estimates
,
is
not
asked
Descartes
but
opacity
.
36 11
France
was
one
of
the
leading
critics
of
Ireland
,
as
the
Irish
Government
,
decreased
its
budget
surplus
,
which
at
the
time
was
4
%
of
GDP
by
only
0.5
%
in
2000
.
23 11
Other
countries
have
also
violated
the
Stability
Pact
,
but
France
is
the
first
country
that
did
this
with
open
malicious
contempt
.
9 6
But
something
like
this
should
not
surprise
anyone
.
22 12
France
turns
simply
on
the
EU
rules
his
inveterate
habits
,
namely
,
to
regard
their
own
culture
as
something
extraordinary
.
18 10
For
example
,
prevented
France
vetoed
by
persistently
reforms
of
the
common
agricultural
policy
-LRB-
GEA
-RRB-
.
37 15
How
even
children
know
the
GEA
is
a
handsome
and
entirely
undeserved
gift
to
the
wealthy
European
-LRB-
especially
French
-RRB-
farmers
at
the
expense
of
struggling
farmers
in
developing
countries
and
consumers
in
the
EU
.
30 11
France
also
tried
again
to
fall
back
on
an
old
policy
,
namely
to
relieve
unprofitable
private
businesses
at
the
edge
of
its
collapse
with
the
taxpayers
'
money
.
35 16
The
European
Commissioner
for
Competition
Policy
,
Mario
Monti
,
can
not
lose
this
fight
:
He
needs
the
support
of
those
who
believe
in
the
market
and
in
the
equal
treatment
of
all
.
9 5
In
this
case
,
things
are
quite
simple
.
35 13
The
French
government
,
the
company
Alstom
plans
to
horrified
,
a
company
that
has
a
number
of
high-tech
products
including
the
TGV
,
the
French
high-speed
stuff
developed
,
but
recently
went
bankrupt
.
36 21
The
French
Government
claims
that
she
would
never
,
insert
it
back
into
their
plan
to
rescue
Alstom
,
a
schedule
of
all
known
justifications
of
statism
:
maintaining
employment
,
protection
of
investors
etc.
.
35 15
Moreover
,
the
French
government
has
,
since
it
is
at
Alstom
a
high-tech
company
is
that
research
and
development
board
,
claiming
investment
in
R
\
x26amp
;
D
are
good
for
growth
.
13 9
save
Alstom
by
the
nationalization
of
the
company
,
is
obviously
wrong
.
8 6
The
company
consists
of
many
different
parts
.
22 17
Some
of
them
bring
profit
,
others
are
bankrupt
:
What
you
have
to
do
is
obviously
to
destroy
the
company
.
25 10
The
profitable
parts
,
such
as
the
TGV
station
are
readily
find
buyers
;
works
that
do
not
make
any
profit
should
be
closed
.
23 12
The
French
taxpayer
money
is
better
spent
on
the
support
of
the
dismissed
workers
than
for
subsidies
to
keep
unprofitable
company
alive
.
27 17
It
is
important
that
the
European
Commission
France
are
not
allowed
to
take
out
as
apparently
in
competition
policy
even
with
its
budget
deficits
special
arrangements
.
27 14
The
Commission
needs
public
aid
to
private
companies
in
France
prevent
just
as
it
has
brought
such
subsidies
in
any
other
EU
Member
State
to
case
.
22 15
The
Commission
has
already
achieved
some
success
on
this
front
,
known
forced
Germany
to
abolish
government
guarantees
for
public
banks
.
22 10
Alstom
in
particular
and
France
in
general
should
make
no
exceptions
,
they
should
have
to
abide
by
the
same
standards
.
21 9
If
the
Commission
fails
to
act
,
the
EU
will
look
even
more
like
the
playground
of
French
government
officials
.
35 13
France
has
already
taken
a
leadership
role
in
the
EU
's
foreign
policy
,
Foreign
Minister
Dominique
de
Villepin
appears
more
and
more
like
the
European
foreign
ministers
in
appearance
and
also
as
is
.
22 8
same
time
,
France
violated
essential
elements
of
the
common
economic
policy
and
the
award
of
public
aid
to
private
companies
.
20 14
Will
the
European
Commission
what
their
credibility
is
left
lose
and
finally
look
like
a
minor
district
of
Paris
?
20 9
A
defeat
in
the
Alstom
case
would
have
far-reaching
consequences
for
Europe
and
not
only
for
its
competition
policy
.
72 21
The
war
for
oil
For
decades
,
America
has
a
number
of
clear
energy
policy
objectives
pursued
consistently
under
democratic
and
republican
out
presidencies
,
namely
to
keep
the
world
oil
prices
as
stable
as
possible
,
to
curb
oil
consumption
in
the
country
on
a
painless
way
possible
dependence
on
foreign
imports
,
wherever
it
is
possible
to
reduce
,
and
divide
the
oil
imports
to
several
countries
of
origin
.
20 10
Even
if
it
seems
to
be
different
,
under
the
Bush
administration
,
none
of
these
goals
has
changed
.
24 17
Many
observers
believe
Bush
had
embarked
on
a
new
course
,
because
the
invasion
seems
to
run
counter
to
these
objectives
in
Iraq
.
43 20
A
large
increase
in
oil
production
in
Iraq
should
the
U.S.
dependence
on
oil
in
relation
to
that
of
other
energy
sources
probably
larger
still
,
as
the
world
oil
prices
are
likely
to
plummet
as
a
result
of
the
additional
offer
.
22 8
This
would
mean
,
in
turn
,
an
increase
of
U.S.
dependence
on
imported
oil
,
particularly
from
the
Middle
East
.
61 21
The
irony
is
,
however
,
that
the
U.S.
''
-LRB-
in
which
the
UN
and
not
Saddam
Hussein
,
the
level
of
Iraqi
oil
sales
to
foreign
countries
certain
-RRB-
greater
control
over
the
Iraqi
oil
sector
exercised
under
the
pre-war
program
of
the
United
Nations
oil-for-food
than
they
which
will
continue
to
do
in
a
democratically
governed
Iraq
.
43 11
If
the
Bush
administration
stable
,
secure
and
cheap
oil
imports
from
many
quarters
would
have
sought
,
she
would
pick
the
embargo
on
countries
such
as
Libya
,
Iran
,
Iraq
and
the
Sudan
and
the
oil
can
hereinschwabben
from
there
.
18 9
But
was
America
's
interest
in
Iraq
's
oil
is
not
of
their
economic
or
energy
policy
.
14 9
The
Bush
administration
realized
that
Iraqi
oil
is
primarily
a
crucial
geopolitical
lever
.
7 7
Whoever
controls
Iraqi
oil
dominated
Iraq
.
18 11
Saddam
's
power
was
based
on
its
control
over
the
second
largest
oil
reserves
in
the
world
.
15 11
undoubtedly
He
understood
the
role
played
by
the
oil
for
his
exercise
of
power
.
23 11
With
the
possibility
of
an
invasion
and
defeat
in
mind
,
Saddam
threatened
to
set
fire
to
the
oil
fields
in
Iraq
.
28 10
Much
of
the
subsequent
destruction
and
looting
of
Iraqi
oil
facilities
and
pipelines
reflects
the
widespread
recognition
that
the
control
of
oil
means
the
rule
in
Iraq
.
17 10
In
the
U.S.
invasion
plans
to
secure
the
oil
fields
has
been
given
a
key
priority
.
31 14
goal
was
not
going
to
extend
the
supplies
and
reduce
prices
for
Americans
,
but
Saddam
to
leave
his
power
base
and
eventually
use
a
new
Iraqi
government
and
stabilize
.
13 8
Iraq
's
future
depends
directly
on
the
fate
of
Iraqi
oil
production
.
38 16
But
the
vagaries
of
the
oil
business
,
especially
under
such
suspicious
circumstances
allow
,
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
Bush
administration
over
the
next
few
years
its
goals
in
Iraq
will
be
able
to
achieve
.
5 5
The
logic
is
simple
.
21 15
The
U.S.
must
use
oil
revenues
to
help
the
American
taxpayers
the
burden
of
financing
the
regime
change
in
Iraq
.
19 12
all
reconstruction
plans
depend
in
the
long
run
by
Iraq
's
ability
to
export
oil
in
large
quantities
.
28 8
If
Iraq
does
not
extradite
its
oil
,
President
Bush
can
not
deliver
on
his
promises
to
the
Iraqi
,
the
American
people
or
the
world
community
.
19 8
Before
the
invasion
amounted
to
the
capacity
of
the
Iraqi
oil
production
to
three
million
barrels
per
day
.
27 12
Iraq
will
increase
its
production
,
can
not
bring
them
back
to
that
level
within
the
time
frame
that
is
compels
to
establish
an
Iraqi
government
.
27 13
Any
increase
in
Iraqi
oil
production
required
to
develop
the
oil
fields
,
which
means
substantial
investment
,
a
legitimate
,
representative
government
and
political
stability
.
13 9
Not
even
the
Bush
administration
believes
that
to
meet
these
conditions
soon
.
15 9
fact
,
political
stability
is
the
most
important
condition
for
raising
the
production
capacity
.
39 15
Historical
examples
from
Iran
,
Kuwait
,
Russia
,
and
even
Iraq
itself
show
that
it
takes
approximately
three
years
after
the
re-attainment
of
political
stability
to
significantly
raise
the
capacity
and
reach
on
to
hold
higher
level
.
42 21
Iraq
requires
several
years
to
write
a
new
constitution
to
establish
a
legitimate
and
democratic
government
to
negotiate
the
division
of
oil
revenues
on
its
various
regions
to
adopt
new
investment
laws
,
and
to
make
its
economy
attractive
to
foreigners
.
33 13
It
still
needs
time
to
negotiate
with
the
international
oil
companies
and
neighboring
countries
,
to
carry
out
technical
feasibility
studies
and
its
oil
fields
to
rebuild
,
get
going
and
explore
.
36 14
therefore
seem
even
a
time
frame
of
three
years
as
optimistic
as
it
presupposes
that
the
occupation
is
terminated
at
this
time
,
the
Iraqis
establish
their
own
democratic
government
and
will
attain
political
stability
.
15 13
One
does
not
need
to
mention
that
the
situation
can
also
develop
very
differently
.
8 7
The
voltages
may
still
persist
for
years
.
19 10
No
one
should
be
surprised
if
the
Iraqi
oil
production
suddenly
stops
altogether
even
under
a
democratic
government
.
27 14
Historical
experience
suggests
that
labor
disputes
and
other
disruptions
that
can
prevent
the
oil
production
,
in
democratic
countries
pose
a
greater
threat
than
in
undemocratic
.
28 8
If
Iraq
's
production
capacity
in
the
next
few
years
can
not
increase
quickly
,
this
will
prevent
both
U.S.
foreign
as
well
as
their
energy
policies
.
13 9
How
do
the
U.S.
reconstruction
of
Iraq
in
the
long
term
finance
?
13 12
Who
will
pay
for
it
to
get
a
fragile
Iraqi
democracy
alive
?
25 13
Can
the
U.S.
maintain
their
occupation
if
they
are
unable
to
provide
food
,
health
care
and
other
basic
services
to
the
Iraqi
people
?
5 5
These
are
uncomfortable
questions
.
24 11
They
remain
fundamentally
unanswerable
,
unless
,
a
stable
,
democratic
regime
in
Iraq
determine
and
ensure
the
steady
flow
of
oil
exports
.

murderer
as
a
guardian
of
human
rights
Were
it
not
so
deeply
sad
,
one
would
have
to
laugh
at
it
:
Libya
has
been
elected
chairman
of
the
UN
Commission
on
Human
Rights
!

21 9
course
,
the
method
was
perfectly
legal
:
the
chairmanship
rotates
every
year
from
one
world
region
to
the
next
.
13 10
This
year
Africa
's
turn
to
choose
the
chairman
and
appointed
Libya
.
9 5
Only
the
United
States
and
Canada
voted
against
.
9 5
To
their
everlasting
shame
,
European
countries
abstained
.
32 13
It
is
indicative
of
the
condition
of
the
moral
corruption
of
the
UN
,
that
this
decision
right
now
,
has
been
made
for
such
a
difficult
time
for
the
organization
.
49 16
President
Bush
,
the
UN
has
asked
to
prove
that
they
are
serious
about
their
Iraq
resolutions
:
otherwise
they
will
the
same
ignominious
fate
as
the
League
of
Nations
,
the
powerless
faced
in
the
30
years
of
the
aggressive
policies
of
Nazi
Germany
and
Fascist
Italy
.
33 16
Libya
to
choose
right
now
in
the
presidency
of
the
UN
organization
that
is
responsible
for
human
rights
,
reflected
negative
impact
on
the
legitimacy
and
moral
authority
of
the
entire
organization
.
32 10
Let
's
remember
:
Libya
is
a
totalitarian
tyranny
,
its
head
of
state
,
Muammar
al-Gaddafi
often
combines
erratic
behavior
with
extremist
politics
by
supporting
the
dictators
of
the
world
.
27 11
He
faces
one
of
the
most
repressive
regimes
in
the
world
where
there
is
not
even
the
pretense
of
elections
and
where
opposition
is
crushed
immediately
.
21 9
Under
his
rule
has
supported
terrorist
organizations
the
world
over
Libya
-
from
the
IRA
to
various
Palestinian
extremist
groups
.

In
the
last
ten
years

been
as
a
symbol
of
the
ideal
of
a
peaceful
world
community
is
constantly
undermined
the
position
of
the
UN
.

She
was
completely
unable
to
prevent
the
wars
in
the
Balkans
and
in
at
least
one
case

Srebrenica
-

a
Dutch
peacekeeping
force
to
the
worst
massacre
in
Europe
since
1945
without
doing
anything
,
in
which

Serbs

murdered
.

Dutch
education
committee
later
admitted
that

troops
were

No

had

,
the
person

for
the
peacekeeping
UN
functionary
ordered
the
withdrawal
of
UN
troops
from
the
country
and
left
the
field
to
the
bloodiest
racist
massacre
since

World
War
.

The
name
of
this
functionary
is
Kofi

.
39 13
The
-
probably
futile
-
attempt
of
the
UN
,
now
to
awaken
in
the
Iraq
crisis
,
the
impression
that
they
speak
with
the
voice
of
reason
and
International
legitimacy
is
to
name
just
depressing
and
pathetic
.
67 23
But
in
a
time
when
the
UN
weapons
inspectors
seem
in
Iraq
like
the
Salvation
Army
,
which
you
send
to
excavate
a
band
of
thugs
,
the
fact
that
Libya
is
transferred
the
chairmanship
of
the
Commission
on
Human
Rights
received
perhaps
than
the
error
in
the
story
which
has
sealed
the
failure
of
an
organization
that
was
founded
with
so
much
hope
in
life
.
25 16
organizations
usually
do
not
go
under
-
and
there
are
certainly
a
lot
of
raison
d'etat
to
ensure
that
the
UN
continues
drags
himself
.
15 11
But
it
is
only
a
shadow
of
what
it
should
be
and
could
be
.

The
UN
today
is
nothing
more
than
another
word
for
hypocrisy
.
25 14
authoritarianism
is
on
the
rise
Last
Thursday
I
was
sentenced
the
judge
at
the
court
in
Jakarta
Indonesian
central
to
one
year
in
prison
.
48 28
As
editor
of
the
news
magazine
Tempo
Weekly
,
I
am
to
have
according
to
the
judgment
,
guilty
of
slandering
a
business
tycoon
named
Tomy
Winata
,
as
I
would
have
submitted
his
possible
involvement
in
a
fire
on
the
Southeast
Asian
textile
market
in
Jakarta
.
13 12
Moreover
,
I
have
been
guilty
of
fomenting
the
riots
spreading
lies
.
21 13
Is
my
case
and
other
similar
cases
already
an
indication
of
the
end
of
another
short-lived
democratic
experiment
in
Indonesia
?
48 16
The
``
riots
''
that
I
allegedly
fomented
took
place
in
March
last
year
,
when
nearly
two
hundred
rioters
,
claiming
to
be
followers
Winatas
,
the
Office
of
pace
attack
,
it
threatened
to
set
on
fire
,
the
staff
harassed
and
a
reporter
injured
.
25 15
In
an
attempt
to
resolve
the
situation
peacefully
,
I
was
persuaded
to
put
myself
to
talk
to
the
central
police
station
in
Jakarta
.
15 8
To
my
horror
to
the
police
station
but
was
under
control
of
the
mob
.
13 9
I
was
beaten
and
kicked
while
the
police
looked
the
other
way
.
15 7
Fortunately
,
many
journalists
came
to
us
with
tape
recorders
and
cameras
to
help
.
20 12
The
publication
of
their
recordings
caused
a
public
outcry
,
which
compelled
the
Parliament
to
hold
a
public
hearing
.
24 8
The
police
chiefs
of
the
country
and
Jakarta
were
summoned
and
the
leaders
of
the
mob
were
criminally
charged
under
massive
public
pressure
.
24 13
However
Winata
escaped
a
police
investigation
,
and
that
only
because
he
claimed
his
supporters
had
acted
without
his
prior
knowledge
and
consent
.
34 13
Then
he
turned
the
tables
and
filed
a
criminal
complaint
against
Ahmad
Taufik
himself
,
the
author
of
the
article
to
the
editor
Teuku
Iskandar
Ali
,
who
edited
it
and
against
me
.
20 13
The
years
of
court
proceedings
were
marked
by
a
series
of
suspicious
developments
,
all
of
which
favored
Winata
.
27 16
First
,
documents
were
presented
in
the
built-up
by
the
police
and
the
prosecutor
case
that
were
so
obviously
fake
that
the
police
accused
two
managers
.
24 15
But
the
court
rejected
our
request
to
methods
deferred
until
the
legal
clarification
of
the
established
by
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
case
.
12 8
The
case
against
the
two
police
officers
seem
to
be
deported
.
24 11
One
of
the
policemen
was
promoted
to
commander
of
the
newly
created
-LRB-
and
funded
by
the
U.S.
-RRB-
anti-terrorist
unit
of
Jakarta
.
15 13
The
other
said
to
have
been
sent
on
a
training
course
for
police
officers
.
37 13
Then
,
in
the
sixth
month
of
the
procedure
,
the
chairman
of
the
three-member
Board
of
Judges
has
been
appointed
to
the
boss
suddenly
a
city
court
,
which
is
located
one
hour
from
Jakarta
.
28 13
One
of
my
lawyers
said
that
it
has
not
happened
to
him
in
his
35-year
career
at
court
,
that
a
presiding
judge
exchanges
during
the
proceedings

20 11
fact
acted
the
judge
,
despite
their
carriage
,
in
another
case
in
the
same
house
continued
as
chairman
.
